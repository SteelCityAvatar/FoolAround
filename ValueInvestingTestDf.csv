2,AI hype looks similar to the Covid boom where earnings were compressed into a single year,1.0,"Does anyone else think this AI hype looks very similar to the COVID boom and investors haven't learned their lessons?

A few things are obvious:

\- AI is obviously going to be massive, like dotcom was eventually, i.e far bigger than cloud, crypto etc

\- Unlike the dotcom bubble, AI companies like NVDA have serious earnings growth.

However it looks to me like ChatGPT (which is genuinely an amazing product) has sparked a massive hype train where ALL companies are pulling in investment from everywhere else and shoving it into AI as they have FOMO.

I have seen this with VC firms, normal companies are being underfunded and all the money is being sucked into AI firms.

I haven't got any data on this but from the outset it looks similar to the frontloading of earnings that happened from COVID, i.e this could happen:

1. Companies are diverting all R&D spend to AI due to FOMO and not wanting to be left behind, this leads to a massive earnings boom for NVDA and other AI companies.
2. Investors incorrectly extrapolate this earnings boom and expect it to keep happening in the following years.
3. Companies later on realise that the ROIC of their new AI integrations are not paying off in the short time frames that they expect, they then pull R&D funding from AI and move it back to normal operations.
4. AI companies earnings like Google Cloud, NVDA, ARM etc absolutely plummet because multiple years investment into AI have been compressed into a single year.
5. AI stocks drop like a rock.

This is the exact same thing that happened in COVID, remote working caused companies like Zoom to boom when in reality 80% of that boom was just moving earnings forward and only 20% was a long term shift in underlying earnings.

Anyone have opinions on this? I haven't seen many people ask this question.

This could provide an opportunity, once companies realise their huge investments in AI aren't paying off and pull them, it would be the time to short AI stocks. Might have to look at many earnings calls later on to extrapolate this.","['has', 'are', 'else', 'be', 'very', 'on', 'AI', 'move', 'when', 'boom', 'rock', 'an', 'NVDA', 'ARM', 'ALL', 'drop', 'any', 'all', 'back', 'aren', 'me', 'it', 'VC', 'for', 'ROIC', 'huge']",,

Others have brought up the dot com boom and I agree. People bet on Cisco, they lost their shirts, despite the internet revolutionizing business. But Amazon also lost 90%, and look where it's at today?

Another example from the Intelligent Investor was aerospace stocks in the 50s. Despite being at the beginning of a new age in air & space, the businesses themselves didn't do great and were overbought, leading to a crash. Even today Warren Buffet won't touch airlines because they have such a high cost of capital. But what industry hasn't been touched by airlines?

This is why I like this sub because we don't find ourselves having to guess at the effects of technological advancement like this. AI will touch every corner of business, so a good boring company with solid fundamentals will, at least of you're correct, benefit greatly from any technological advancements."

AMD is moving to compete and I‚Äôm sure Intel isn‚Äôt just sitting there. NVDAs main competitive edge is CUDA. The hardware they make is really good but it‚Äôs the industry reliance on CUDA that keeps people in the ecosystem. At some point, businesses will transition to other methodologies. Supposedly, CUDA processes can run on AMD cards using ZLUDA so the CUDA moat might be eroding more rapidly than people expect. Big Tech also are just monster businesses and I don‚Äôt think they will tolerate being taken advantage of for long. If prices stay too high, they will just design their own ASICs. ASICs are probably more suited to what they want anyway and will consume less power to run.

These potentially negative catalysts will take some time to emerge so I‚Äôm pretty confident NVDA will absolutely destroy earnings and skyrocket but I‚Äôm just not a long term buyer at these prices. The outlook is too rosy. Sure there is a lot of short term upside that could happen but all it takes is a single headwind or whiff of bad news and this thing is plummeting. AI doesn‚Äôt actually make any money and I have no idea who the real winners will be beyond the usual suspects. Probably big tech and companies centered around chip production like TSM and LRCX.

I guess the difference is that AI is itself a source of productivity, so the question becomes if capital is a **limiting factor**. 

If it is, pulling forward the AI growth would bring forward the productivity boom.

Of course trading on the secondary markets would only have an indirect effect. The primary markets will be the asset allocators and kingmakers. 

On the other hand, higher valuations in the secondary markets would mean more attractive exits for the PE/VC guys, so they'll probably loosen their purse strings as well."

This is the part that nobody seems to understand yet. Most AI is currently just a super-powered version of the predictive text feature on your phone. If you're doing things like coding where there are established rules it works great. Anything that requires nuance or trying to reason is much more questionable.  


All the investment pouring in is operating under the assumption that AI will *eventually* be able to do all these incredible things. The problem is nobody knows whether that will actually happen. There are researchers who doubt it will ever be able to truly think or reason. And even people like Sam Altman are saying we'll never get there without a breakthrough in energy technology to power it all."

I don't.  In certain applications, where the subject matter is simple, predictable, and voluminous, chatbots certainly have a helpful role to play, but it's more like giving pianists a piano with a longer keyboard and a new type of pedal than reinventing what music is.  

In applications where the output must be trusted ('read this contract and tell me if there's anything dodgy in it') LLMs are proving themselves not just untrustworthy but actively dangerous.  Yes, the models only get better but it's a fundamental limitation of the current generation of models.  Once a few large businesses get their fingers burnt relying on what a bot told them, I think we'll see more realistic use cases and ultimately valuations."

i agree AI is pretty dumb. But pretty dumb is good enough intelligence to replace nearly all of the workforce. The difficult thing and how far it gets implemented will be how AI interfaces with existing systems.

53,How I analyze stocks for the long-term: Framework walkthrough,2.0,"I wrote a post a few days back on why we should learn to invest in individual stocks. You can read the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1amihwf/why_you_should_learn_to_invest_in_individual/).

In this post, I will share the process I have been using to analyze individual stocks. It requires fair bit of work and thinking, but it‚Äôs worth the effort for the clarity I get.

When we buy a stock, we are buying piece of a business. By asking a series of structured questions, I try to understand how the underlying business works, predict what it will be like in a few years, and estimate a reasonable price for buying it whole.

I don‚Äôt want to spent weeks and months doing complex analysis and financial modeling like institutional investors. My goal is to do simple evaluation of publicly traded companies by putting in reasonable effort to arrive at a conclusion that makes sense for me as an the individual investor.

Even though I only intend to buy few stocks, I think that I will be buying the whole business and keep it for many years. And to figure out if I want to purchase it, I try to answer these six questions:

1. **What does the business do?**
2. **Is it a good business?**
3. **If it‚Äôs a good business, why is it good?**
4. **Can it remain a good business in future too?**
5. **Is it run by competent and honest people?**
6. **Is it available at a fair price?**

Let‚Äôs take a hypothetical example to illustrate how this investing framework can be applied. Imagine that a popular sandwich store in our neighborhood just became available for sale. We have money in bank and are seriously considering buying it. I will try to answer these questions in order (We will skip management analysis in this example as it‚Äôs more applicable for public companies)

**1. What does this business do?** We want to figure out how does this business work and make money. There are four main things to understand:

* What does the business sell? *(sandwiches, drinks, cookies)*
* Who are the customers? *(locals vs tourists, old vs young, rich vs poor)*
* How does it sell its products and services? *(what are the channels: in-store vs online orders vs group catering)*
* What are its costs? *(ingredients, labor, rent, marketing)*

**2. Is it a good business?** Once we have a decent understanding of how the business works, we want to look at its health. More specifically,

* Does it have a clean balance sheet? *(is it loaded up with debt? And how much assets the store owns?)*
* What are the sales of the store? *(revenue from sale of food and drinks)*
* What are the profit margins like? *(gross profit and net profit)*
* How much cash does the store generates? *(operating cash and free cash flow)*
* What‚Äôs the return on invested capital? *(Am I better off just buying risk-free bonds?)*
* How have these numbers grown or declined in last few years? How does these numbers compare to industry average and other similar food joints?

**3. What makes it a good business?** So far if we think it‚Äôs a good business, we now want to understand why is it so and how it stands out from competition.

* Who are its competitors? *(local joints, larger chains, other eateries)*
* Does it have a competitive advantage or a ‚Äúmoat‚Äù *(hard to have moats in food industry for local stores, but few have a strong brand)*
* Why do customers keep coming back to this place? Or will they keep paying even when we raise prices?

**4. Will it continue to be a good business in future?** This is where we need to think strategically about future, especially about three aspects:

* Is the company‚Äôs moat durable? *(If the owner or chef leaves, will the business tank? What can harm the brand?)*
* What are the main risks the business face? *(What if key suppliers go out of business or increase prices? Can changing customer preferences towards healthier foods impact sales?)*
* What are the biggest opportunities? *(is there potential for expanding store locations, increasing menu items, hiking prices, or cutting costs)*

**5. Is the business available at a fair price?** Now we bring it all together and assess if the current offer price is reasonable or too high. This needs a bit of number crunching, but we will avoid complex projections on heavy excel sheets.

* What drives earning growth? *(economy in general, influx of residents, inflation?)*
* How would the earnings grow in next few years? *(Future is uncertain and probabilistic so we need to think of worst, likely, and best case scenarios)*
* What would be the value of this business after a few years? *(what kind of multiple it is available today on earnings or sales? what will be a reasonable multiple in future?)*
* Will I loose a lot of money if things go wrong? *(Is there some margin of safety in price I am paying)*
* Given all this, what‚Äôs a price that I am happy to pay today? *(One that will meet my return expectations at risk I am comfortable with)*
* If the asking price is higher or lower than my happy price, why is that the case? *(Do I understand why owner is asking for lower price or why market is valuing it lower? What am I missing?)*

After I have good enough answers to these questions, I will put pen to paper and summarize my thinking in a crisp 1-pager. This will becomes my investing thesis and guide me to make a buy or pass decision. This is exactly the same process we can follow for analyzing any publicly listed company.

For every dozen or so 1-pagers I have write, I will *maybe* invest in one. Sometimes I won‚Äôt understand the business well enough and other times I won‚Äôt like the price. But that's okay! I know that I have done the hard part already. I will keep the stock in my watchlist, move on to the next stock, and update the analysis from time to time if I liked the business.

As you can imagine, this is simple but not easy. It‚Äôs not for everyone. But it is very satisfying and intellectually stimulating. And like every other skill, it gets easier with practice.

That's it! That's the process I use. I would love to hear you feedback on how I can improve on this. Also, if this is interesting, I can write few posts on diving deeper into each of these sub-parts with an example of a public stock.

57,CPS (Cooper Standard Holdings) Q4 Report - Big opportunity or major loss?,3.0,"Full disclosure - I've had a significant position in this company since it was <$15 a share.

CPS (Cooper Standard Holdings) just reported its Q4 results and they were...odd. The company's snapshot was as follows:

>Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. (CPS) on Thursday reported a loss of $55.2 million in its fourth quarter.  
>  
>On a per-share basis, the Northville, Michigan-based company said it had a loss of $3.16. Losses, adjusted for non-recurring costs, were $1.79 per share.

Seems pretty bad...until you couple it with the fact the company also reported a massive increase towards free cash flow of $62.1 million. Keep in mind this business was FCF negative for years up until Q3 of this year, where it reported a FCF of \~$4 million. In fact, this number is a $100 million increase compared to the same quarter in 2022. In trying to understand this delta, I considered the possibility that maybe the company was finding cash through other means, such as liquidation. However, digging through its report, I noted the following:

>Free cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less CAPEX) in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $62.1 million, an increase of $100.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was **driven primarily by improved operating earnings, inventory conversion, and collections on enhanced commercial agreements and tooling receivables.**

It seems that the company has reestablished healthy cash flow streams from being able to turnover inventory and capitalize on collections. The net loss, on the other hand, was explained by the following:

>The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter sales was primarily attributable to sustainable price adjustments, inflation recoveries, favorable volume and mix, and favorable foreign exchange, **partially offset by lost production volume related to union work stoppages and the deconsolidation or divestiture of non-core businesses.**  
>  
>The year-over-year improvement in fourth quarter net loss was primarily due to savings generated from lean manufacturing and purchasing initiatives, lower tax expense, favorable price adjustments, and lower raw material costs. These positive factors were **partially offset by higher interest expense, pension settlement charges, increased accruals for annual incentive compensation, lost production volume related to union work stoppages, continuing inflationary pressure, including higher labor and energy costs.**

What I took particular note of here was the attribution to ""lost production volume related to union work stoppages."" The UAW strike occurred during all of October, eating significantly into Q4.

My thought process is that the delta between cash flow and profits might be attributable to accrual accounting. Work stoppages cause a delay in orders from auto manufacturers in October, halting supplier production. Once the stoppages are addressed, orders continue, but now there's a significant lag time between purchase and delivery. The cash received is recorded as cash flow in Q4 but the revenue isn't recorded until the order is fulfilled, which would be in Q1 of the next year.

Is this a potential opportunity, where the market reacts to the topline number but ignores the underlying financials? I'd love to hear other people's thoughts.

Imagine you‚Äôre holding a 20-year bond paying 7% coupon when the market rate is only 2%. Naturally investors will flock to you and PAY YOU A LOT MORE than the face value of the bond to buy it off you, so that the investor has the right to the future cash flows of the bond. Especially since TLT is considered near risk free of default. This alone will give you equity-like return.  

But of course, one has to understand that TLT carries a higher degree of duration risk, I.e. your future cash flows are subject to steep discounts if the risk free rates rise and thus reduce the value of TLT.

A bond's yield changes based on how much you pay for it - paying $100 for a bond that yields $1 is 1%, but pay $50 and thats now a 2% yielding bond

Sensitivity to interest rates is expressed by a variable called Duration. The longer the bond's maturity, the more duration, and the more its price will fluctuate when interest rates change.

Re-invest the dividends and that will just go up and up and up.

If the earnings grow by 5%, then the share price and dividend will too (in theory), obviously life is a bit more complex than that. But if the earnings grow by 5% then your dividend yield wont be 3% next year, it will be 3% of the new share price, your new yield will be 3%\*5%.

you will also have capital gains, but we dont care about that, we never want to sell our capital gains, we want them to snowball and cllect more dividends!

So 6000\*5% appriciate = ¬£6300, so maybe rent money+some coffee money now. Re-investing the dividend would have bought you an extra 3% in equity too, so next years diivdend you'll get:

200k original equity + 6k dividend reinvested \* 5% Earnigns growth \* 3% dividend at higher earnings yield = ¬£6,489 = ¬£222,789 in 1 year.

This is assuming 5% earnings growth, oh if the world was this lovely and neat. You'll have years of eating shit and years of caviar. But let it keep rolling and eventually all your expenses will be covered by a 3% dividend on a shit eating year.

At the very least you might be able to drop down to 3-4 days a week early in life."

If you are in a Buffett company, even a former Buffett company, you are probably fine."
