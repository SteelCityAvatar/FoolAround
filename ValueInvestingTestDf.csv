By selling there could be a huge shareholder windfall and unlock of value in the $7-9 per share range.

(Oil and gas company mostly operating in North Dakota). They are merging with Chord (CHRD) for 0.10125 shares of CHRD per ERF share, plus $1.84 in cash per ERF share. CHRD just went ex-dividend today for a $3.25 dividend, and Enerplus just paid a 6.5 cent dividend. However, the merger agreement says:

""It is anticipated that the quarterly dividend payments made by Enerplus until closing of the transaction will be equalized to those made by Chord, after giving effect to the exchange ratio, through an additional Enerplus dividend declared shortly prior to the closing.""

~~So if I by my math, ERF shareholders should receive another 29 cent dividend prior to closing, and with CHRD at $161, each ERF should be worth about $18.43, instead of $17.76 where it is trading now. So a decent arb opportunity if you want to own CHRD.~~

I think the combined CHRD is significantly undervalued compared to other large cap oil companies. Based on their combined reserves reports, it looks like they are trading at a ~15% discount to PV-10, while most oil companies trade at a ~20% premium. They are also one of the cheapest in terms of FCF/EV and they have a strong shareholder returns history.

On the macro side, OPEC just extended their oil production cuts for another 3 months, so oil prices should be well supported in the short term. Also, EQT announced today they would cut back production, so natural gas prices may improve in the coming months."

I went into it knowing it's a very high risk penny stock. I liked it's growth and it's outlook and did heavy DD on the stock. 

But Graham's book, and importantly the commentary on chapter 11 in the revised edition, made 2 points that really stood out and turned me against the stock 

The first point is that the bad companies can get addicted to other people's money, in the case of KULR constantly issuing new shares to raise capital.

The second point was that bad managers will try to hype a stock by issuing useless press releases. 

This stock is failing both of those points.

It has a forward PE of around 49-50, and missed on expected revenue by $690m. To justify a PE that high they need to show a large amount of growth. If they meet their earnings estimates, they're still going to be trading at a PE of around 40 in 2026.

China is literally undergoing deflation from weak consumer spending and record youth unemployment. 

The Chinese market is filled with phones at different price ranges. What is the more likely stronger contributing factor to this phenomenon?

I changed my approach a bit(taking idea from a comment) and took a weighted ROCE average based on the revenue. So a company having more revenue in an industry will have a higher weight in the avg ROCE calculation.

Note that the ROCE is in % so the values are  really low. Which means companies which bring in the most revenue on average are not really efficient.

Coking coal being the first is a surprise. I think they are not deploying much capital anymore? What are your thoughts?

**Technical Details**

* First I fetched all industries data for the time range as above.
* For 2022 I grouped companies by industries then calculated the total revenue. This is after I converted all revenue to USD from different currencies.
* Only kept ROCE with 1 to 100% value.
* Only considered those industries where sample was greater than 30 companies.
* Then for each company I calculated weight = revenue / industry\_revenue\_total
* Then multiplied ROCE with this to get weighted\_roce
* Finally for each industry I took the mean by grouping the companies in the same industry.
* For time range 2014-2030 the steps are mostly the same.
* The change is first we calculate the weigthed ROCE for each year. Then calculate the average of this weighted ROCE across time 2014-2015 for each symbol.
* After that we calculate the industry average ROCE with the average weighted ROCE across time.","['For', 'top', 'So', 'low', 'so', 'www', 'two', 'for', 'are', 'on', 'Real', 'an', 'Life', 'post', 'bit', 'by', 'Note', 'all']",,

There are regulatory blocks preventing them from expanding capacity or even getting financing, however demand is only increasing. As a result, you get companies like AMR declaring half their market cap in buybacks (it went up after, now ~25% are declared) up 100x since their covid lows. Other types of coal are similar though not quite as profitable. I am very overweight Glencore, who has bought out the #1 and #9 producers in coal's production. I also hold Mechel, but sanctions on Russia have made that in accessible."

Include negative returns?  These measures mean different things to different people and are malleable so they can be used to make just about any industry look good or bad.  You will need to clearly state the terms, the measures and standards to result in any meaningful results.

Well, I used to own it. Bought it when it dipped to $16 back in 2022, sold around $25 a year later. I do think the business is likely worth something closer to high $30's but it's trading at maybe a 6% fwd FCF yield (4% TTM FCF yield) and that's not great when the primary vehicle for shareholder returns is likely buybacks. 

The market can remain irrational on a price multiple for a long time, and, historically, it has on PMI businesses. If the stock is trading at a 15%+ FCF yield, then sure, one can get paid to wait, but I don't think waiting around for multiple expansion at a 6% FCF yield makes sense. 

Ofc, if one thinks the business can rapidly increase earnings, things change for the better, but NMIH has its foundation laid as a competitively priced operator with smaller market share because it is an incredibly disciplined underwriter. If it increases price, it likely loses market share, if it relaxes underwriting it likely gains share but starts to suffer the same margin drag some of its competitors do. Obviously, the massive up move in rates will start to form a tailwind for NMIH's investment portfolio, likely at least a 2 year one, so that part of earnings I very much believe will grow and grow quickly. I just don't buy the rest."

So, I want to have say anywhere from 50-60% of my portfolio in businesses that I think can compound north of 18-20% a year while buying them cheaply.  The rest of my portfolio is more bottom barrel, super cheap (very low debt, high FCF yield) stuff.  I usually do really well on this super cheap stuff, so like a James River, TDCX (sold it), Perion, etc. My concern and reason why I've slowly started to add more of these compounders into the portfolio is because I'm worried that there will be less of these quality super cheap opportunities going forward, so I do not want to be as dependent on that one style.  If there's less of those, then there's a drag on my performance.  Buying these durable compounders cheaply almost acts as an anchor for my portfolio, allowing me more space to beat my benchmark.  Sometimes I'll buy stuff that's off-cycle when I really understand the cycle (Crude carriers in late '21), but those are pretty rare.

&#x200B;

Allocation is simple.  Highest conviction picks get the biggest allocation.  So really anything above 5% is a very high conviction pick for me.  The stuff beneath that I still carry confidence, but less.  Turnover varies by a very large degree.  Turnover was pretty high last year with the regional bank trades, but normally turnover is pretty low.

Also trades at a substantial discount valuation wise to peers like Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey to name a couple.  So worst case scenario, if the partnerships business (their asset light model) doesn't grow at all and you just have the closing of valuation gap, you're IRR is still something like 27% over the next five years.

201,Long (BLDR) and homebuilder stocks. President Biden Announces Plan to Lower Housing Costs for Working Families,8.0,"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-plan-to-lower-housing-costs-for-working-families/  
  
  
Building and preserving over 2 million new homes to lower rents and the cost of buying a home  
  
President Biden believes housing costs are too high, and significant investments are needed to address the large shortage of affordable homes inherited from his predecessor and that has been growing for more than a decade. During his State of the Union Address, President Biden will call on Congressional Republicans to end years of inaction and pass legislation to lower costs by providing a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers and people who sell their starter homes; build and renovate more than 2 million homes; and lower rental costs. President Biden also announced new steps to lower homebuying and refinancing closing costs and crack down on corporate actions that rip off renters.  
  
We are starting to see some progress. More housing units are under construction right now than at any time in the last 50 years, rents have fallen over the last year in many places, and the homeownership rate is higher now than before the pandemic. But rent is still too high, and Americans who want to buy a home still have difficulty finding one they can afford. That is why President Biden has a landmark plan to build over 2 million homes, which will lower rents, make houses more affordable, and promote fair housing.  
  
Lowering Costs of Homeownership  
  
For many Americans, owning a home is the cornerstone of raising a family, building wealth, and joining the middle class. Too many working families feel locked out of homeownership and are unable to compete with investors for a limited supply of affordable for-sale homes. President Biden is calling on Congress to enact legislation to enable more Americans to purchase a home, including:  
  
Mortgage Relief Credit. President Biden is calling on Congress to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide middle-class first-time homebuyers with an annual tax credit of $5,000 a year for two years. This is the equivalent of reducing the mortgage rate by more than 1.5 percentage points for two years on the median home, and will help more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase their first home over the next two years. The President’s plan also calls for a new credit to unlock inventory of affordable starter homes, while helping middle-class families move up the housing ladder and empty nesters right size. Many homeowners have lower rates on their mortgages than current rates. This “lock-in” effect makes homeowners more reluctant to sell and give up that low rate, even in circumstances where their current homes no longer fit their household needs. The President is calling on Congress to provide a one-year tax credit of up to $10,000 to middle-class families who sell their starter home, defined as homes below the area median home price in the county, to another owner-occupant. This proposal is estimated to help nearly 3 million families.  
  
Down Payment Assistance for First-Generation Homeowners. The President continues to call on Congress to provide up to $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-generation homebuyers whose families haven’t benefited from the generational wealth building associated with homeownership. This proposal is estimated to help 400,000 families purchase their first home.  
  
The President isn’t waiting for Congress to lower costs for homebuyers and homeowners. Last year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reduced the mortgage insurance premium for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgages, saving an estimated 850,000 homebuyers and homeowners an estimated $800 per year. And today, the President is announcing new actions to lower the closing costs associated with buying a home or refinancing a mortgage.  
  
Lowering Closing Costs for Refinancing. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has approved policies and pilots to reduce closing costs for homeowners, including a pilot to waive the requirement for lender’s title insurance on certain refinances. This would save thousands of homeowners up to $1500, and an average of $750, and the lower upfront fees will unlock substantial savings for homeowners as mortgage rates continue to fall and more homeowners are able to refinance. According to independent analysis, across the market title insurance typically pays out only 3% to 5% of premiums in claims to consumers, compared to more than 70% in other types of insurance. Homeowners can still purchase their own title insurance policies if they choose to do so.  
  
Lowering Closing Costs for Home Mortgages. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will pursue rulemaking and guidance to address anticompetitive closing costs imposed by lenders on homebuyers and homeowners. These charges—which benefit the lender but not the borrower—can add thousands to the upfront costs of a mortgage. Those upfront costs cut into the amount of homebuyers’ down payments and reduce homeowners’ available equity.  
  
In the coming months, the Department of Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office will convene a roundtable of relevant industry stakeholders, including consumer advocates and academics, in order to discuss the title insurance industry and analyze potential reforms. Building on today’s announcements, President Biden is calling on federal agencies to take all available actions to lower costs for consumers at the closing table and help more Americans access homeownership.  
  
Lowering Costs by Building and Preserving 2 Million Homes  
  
America needs to build more housing in order to lower rental costs and increase access to homeownership. That’s why the President is calling on Congress to pass legislation to build and renovate more than 2 million homes, which would close the housing supply gap and lower housing costs for renters and homeowners. This legislation would build on executive actions in the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan that contributed to record housing construction last year.  
  
Tax Credits to Build More Housing. President Biden is calling for an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to build or preserve 1.2 million more affordable rental units. Renters living in these properties save hundreds of dollars each month on their rent compared with renters with similar incomes who rent in the unsubsidized market. The President is also calling for a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, the first tax provision to build or renovate affordable homes for homeownership, which would lead to the construction or preservation of over 400,000 starter homes in communities throughout the country.  
  
Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion. The President is unveiling a new $20 billion competitive grant fund as part of his Budget to support communities across the country to build more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. This fund would support the construction of affordable multifamily rental units; incentivize local actions to remove unnecessary barriers to housing development; pilot innovative models to increase the production of affordable and workforce rental housing; and spur the construction of new starter homes for middle-class families. According to independent analysis, this will create hundreds of thousands of units which will help lower rents and housing costs.  
  
Increasing Banks’ Contributions Towards Building Affordable Housing. The President is proposing that each Federal Home Loan Bank double its annual contribution to the Affordable Housing Program – from 10 percent of prior year net income to 20 percent – which will raise an additional $3.79 billion for affordable housing over the next decade and assist nearly 380,0000 households. These funds will support the financing, acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of affordable rental and for-sale homes, as well as help low- and moderate-income homeowners to purchase or rehabilitate homes.  
  
Lowering Costs for Renters  
  
President Biden is also taking actions to lower costs and promote housing stability for renters. The White House Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights lays out the key principles of a fair rental market and has already catalyzed new federal actions to make those principles a reality. Today, President Biden is announcing new steps to crack down on unfair practices that are driving up rental costs:  
  
Fighting Rent Gouging by Corporate Landlords. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to combat egregious rent increases and other unfair practices that are driving up rents. Corporate landlords and private equity firms across the country have been accused of illegal information sharing, price fixing, and inflating rents. As part of the Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing announced by President Biden on Tuesday, the President is calling on federal agencies to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior that hikes prices on American families through anti-competitive, unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent business practices. In a recent filing, the Department of Justice (DOJ) made clear its position that inflated rents caused by algorithmic use of sensitive nonpublic pricing and supply information violate antitrust laws. Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission and DOJ filed a joint brief further arguing that it is illegal for landlords and property managers to collude on pricing to inflate rents – including when using algorithms to do so.  
  
Cracking Down on Rental Junk Fees. Millions of families incur burdensome costs in the rental application process and throughout the duration of their lease, from “convenience fees” simply to pay rent online to fees charged to sort mail or collect trash. These fees are often more than the actual cost of providing the service, or are added onto rents to cover services that renters assume are included—or that they don’t even want. Last fall, the FTC proposed a rule that if finalized as proposed would ban misleading and hidden fees across the economy, including in housing rental agreements. Last month, HUD released a summary of banned non-rent fees within their rental assistance programs. These actions build on voluntary commitments the President announced last summer from major rental housing platforms to provide customers with the total, upfront cost on rental properties on their platform.  
  
Expanding Housing Choice Vouchers. Over the last three years, the Administration has secured rental assistance for more than 100,000 additional households. The President is calling on Congress to further expand rental assistance to more than half of a million households, including by providing a voucher guarantee for low-income veterans and youth aging out of foster care – the first such voucher guarantees in history. Receiving a voucher would save these households hundreds of dollars in rent each month.","['when', 'For', 'pay', 'or', 'low', 'www', 'move', 'well', 'pays', 'do', 'up', 'are', 'fund', 'Loan', 'on', 'next', 'an', 'any', 'net', 'key', 'has', 'root', 'care', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'Bill', 'onto', 'two', 'BLDR', 'rent', 'Fund', 'save', 'Low', 'Rent', 'out', 'now', 'cost', 'it', 'for', 'by', 'add', 'all']",,

Keep slurping up those promises though. The lowest quartile of earners advanced for 4 straight years, and then Biden came in and put them back on their heels.

Much of the data in the article is from when Trump was president, not Biden. Additionally, if you just count numerically the amount of audit course non millionaires will be higher, there are way more of them. It's not accounting for population size.

You can keep trying to use things like ""slurping up promises"", but I've shown you facts and you've shown me facts about Trump and then blamed them on Biden. Only one of us is slurping something here...."
221,OSK – is this really a property developer?,9.0,"OSK Holdings carried out a corporate exercise in 2014, to merge PJ Development Holdings Berhad  and OSK Property Holdings Berhad into the group. Effectively OSK Holdings is now a property counter with property development & construction, investment properties and some manufacturing as it main operations.

  
But is this really the case? When you look at its profit profile as shown in the chart, you will find that the bigger contributor over the past 9 years was not from its operations. The non-operating segment - its investments in RHB bank - accounted for a bigger part of its profits. [https://i.postimg.cc/RhS06qnH/OSK-profit-profile.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RhS06qnH/OSK-profit-profile.png)

So, is this a property company or something else? If you are thinking of investing in OSK, shouldn’t you be looking at the performance of the Malaysian banking sector rather than the property sector?
