But does anyone else see a potential buy in for any energy stocks right now . Since majority I am seeing insider buying energy stocks like XOM. The pattern is showing an upward trend but majority of energy stocks hit passed the bottom trend line. Making the energy sector seem short term undervalued . As well as we are still in a bull market.

\- Images too small, especially text on charts is tiny. And there quite a lot of charts.

\- It is too long to find that article not mentioned Net Income last 3 quarters was negative. I not looking EU markets usually and maybe I am mistaken. Taken numbers from Yahoo finance. If this is correct, wel it is Germany. It is in recession, BASF going to build plant in China, Mercedes's electric Smart will be built by Geely in China, government discussing rising retirement age. Who will pay rents?

I would say it all possible to improve, but realistically would Germany be able to focus on work and business efficiency more then on older generation comfort. It is a great question.

PS Upvote - efforts on article are impressive."

\- I will have to see if I can improve the charts in the next article. I believe you can click on them to make them larger, unless your viewing from a mobile.

\- I like to look in areas of markets which don't seem to be doing very well for oversold assets rather than markets everybody likes. This is perhaps an area I could have gone into more in my risks section. I agree Germany is experiencing temporary economic problems and the government at the moment may not be helping things. But it also has a highly skilled and educated population and has turned things around before. It went from being the sick man of Europe to the best performing economy coming out of the GFC. I'm not saying there's going to be a repeat, but I think they'll be able to afford the rent. In addition given the margin of safety your getting when buying Vonovia even if there are some problems the valuation leaves a lot of room for problems.

Thanks for your comments"
6,"[Weekly Megathread] Markets and Value Stock Ideas, Week of November 13, 2023",,,['US'],12.0,">I agree Germany is experiencing temporary economic problems

One guy from US told inflation is transitory, but now he saying higher for longer :).

Germany have outstanding potential. I absolutely agree those issues are temporary.  However there should be measures taken to fix those and this situation is not something happen in near past. It is the result of last decade+ of systematic issues. Now if all issues will be fixed ""today"", optimistically it will take few years to put it all back on track and it will not be easy. And ""today"" fix is impossible to begin with, as Germany seems to have no understanding what to do.

For example  Germany desperately needs labor and changes visas policy. Sounds like positive. However society sometimes not so friendly to newcomers. Other issue is Germany built around incentives of social benefits (high taxes). But those who actually want to build business around innovations (high risk investments) have less interest in Germany as taxes high. There are many more examples like this when Germany see the problem, implementing the fix but same time starting to push back improvements and results are far from being outstanding.

I would say last couple years Germany seems started to accept problem and looking for solutions. The current government way better then previous one, yet there is a lot to be done and it is not something can be improved in one day."
7,"[Weekly Megathread] Markets and Value Stock Ideas, Week of November 13, 2023",,,"['EU', 'US', 'EUR']",15.0,"I get your point. It cannot collapse too much. The renting business can be defensive against inflation, but is not it possible to find some growing asset for 5 years?  Here few examples to think over:

\- Quite a lot of real - estate in Italy  is given now for 1 EUR and this is not the only country in EU with aging population. If there is not enough income nobody want live in a depressed place.

\- I would expect developed economy like Germany to have more efficient labor than average. However here [Istanbul apartments](https://www.hepsiemlak.com/en/istanbul-satilik?p31=2500000&p32=3100000&p33=1) for less than 100k EUR. What would be possible to build and buy in Berlin for this much? My point here is Germany can improve it's efficiency in real - estate building at some point and self cost of 1m2 apartment building suddenly would be around 1k EUR. This is the the matter of taxes, regulations and labor efficiency. Istanbul very good example as it is a big city with strict regulations in seismic place and high building volume. But if it feels like extreme you could check detached house building cost in US (much more expensive than apartment building)."

If you want one fund only, you could do AVGE for a set it amd forget it. It's basically VT with a value tilt.

If you want more value exposure, you could pair VT with AVGV like 70/30 or whatever your risk tolerance allows. I was going to do this but realized I wanted to overweight emerging markets and eliminate mid/small cap growth drag, so I ended up using a few more funds.

I'm 32 and just reallocated my IRA to the following

VOO 59%
AVUV 10%

AQR did some important work on this.  The TLDR is that small caps don't have a different risk premia.  It's all just additional beta.  This is just to say that to the extent that small caps beat large caps, it's because they have higher beta.   
([https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/There-is-No-Size-Effect-Daily-Edition](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/There-is-No-Size-Effect-Daily-Edition))

The other thing about small caps is that many of them are not profitable, so small cap indices are negatively loaded on the profitability / quality factors, which is not necessarily something you want.

Dimensional Funds have some small cap multi factor funds that account for this. They make sure the factor exposure is tilted to value and profitability.  If you're going to do small cap index investing, that would be a good place to start."

""Generous buffer rules and trading windows help tame turnover and the associated trading costs. For a holding to move into an adjacent index, its style traits or market-cap must change considerably. Should that occur, the fund initially trades 50% of the stock's market cap to protect against one-off fluctuations. This has put a lid on turnover, which has averaged less than 20% annually since 2014. CRSP spreads trades over five days to mitigate market-impact costs at each quarterly rebalance. ""

Similarly on the other side, they slow down the purchases of the losers (who have fallen into the small value space) to counteract the momentum effect.

The approach is specifically about measuring price to book, but I believe the same principle would apply for market cap falling from mid to small.

It has a forward P/E of 20 among its profitable companies versus 10 for AVUV. My take is you either tilt small cap value with something such as what Dimensional or Avantis offer (which are 'actively' managed but in a systematic sense), or you don't bother tilting at all. Moreover, small cap 'growth' is a notoriously bad asset class to invest in so you want to focus on value within your small caps. The Russell 2K is a mixture of growth and value. AVUV is value tilted.

I looked into doing an extreme value tilt like the ""ginger ale"" portfolio, but don't know if my belief in the SCV premium is quite THAT strong, but that could change. Given my age, I know I need to make up my mind soon as to whether I want to adopt a more extreme value tilt because I know it can be a bumpy ride.

As I mentioned, I haven't really taught myself how to do valuations yet, so the only single company I feel totally comfortable putting a lot of money into would be BTI.

The thing I'm wondering about the value premiums is whether the market is cyclical in regards to what is profitable. For instance, large cap growth/tech stocks have done wonderfully the last decade or so. It sounds like SCV is ""predicted"" to do really well for the next 10-30 years (still wondering who can predict the market accurately). Then perhaps mid caps will be the next profitable sector for 20 years. Then perhaps bonds will return more than equities for a decade.

I can't tell you how many times I've switched my base IRA holding between VT, VOO & VTI. It's asinine. In my taxable brokerage I hold all three. I think I thrive on information. Feeling like I KNOW what I'm doing is what will give me conviction and I know I still have so much more to learn.

You're probably right about VTI & VOO, back testing certainly suggests that.

I looked at VXUS and how it's about 1/3 emerging markets versus developed. My intention was to overweigh emerging because I feel that in general, it's undervalued. For that reason I'm holding 14% EM, 17% developed, but I'm still feeling my way through the strategy and learning along the way. 

I was kind of paralyzed to take action for a while too because I heard that in dealing with SCV, you can't really change strategies midway through. However, I don't really see that being entirely true so long as your positions are up. If they are down, yea, I think you're kind of committed to keep contributing at that point and you better believe in your strategy.

As far as taxable versus retirement, I think it's wise to be aware of any kind of tax drag, but it's not a major concern of mine. My approach is more about the intention for that account. Yes, money is fungible, but I'm less inclined to take risks with my retirement account. I'm seeking compensated risk exposure in my IRA, but I'm not likely to pick individual stocks. 

When I have anticipated expenses, I look at the time frame. If it's less than 5 years, I'll hold the money in T-bills or a MMF. My brokerage account is specifically for a home downpayment 5-10 years off. I'm just getting used to how I want to invest with it, but my current targets are as follows: 25% VT, 25% BND/VGIT, 25% value picks (including AVUV because I believe the profitability is closer rather than farther) and 25% BTI, a value pick in itself with a great dividend. Sure, it's equity heavy for a 5-10 year timeframe, but there isn't much more reliable than addiction and BTI is moving with the times and adapting with regulation insofar as they are getting into cannabis and many smokeless tobacco products. Dividends don't make the whole picture, but I think BTI is a great buy right now. The dividend certainly doesn't hurt.

I suggest picking only stocks you understand and ones that would be considered a value stock.  For long term investments there are a couple of spreadsheet out there for US & Can dividend stocks.  They list all stocks that pay a dividend, grow the dividend and never cut the dividend.  Those dividend champions tend to be safe stocks to invest long term in.
Then I buy them whe the market or that sector is down a certain percentage.  The nice thing about dividend stocks are that they pay you to hold them.  For example Can Banks pay ~4% and they always come back, even the banking crisis the US lost some major banking institutions, but TD RY those came back just fine.  Plus they continued paying me dividends while they were down.
If you have a small account, an advantage to VOO or even secto ETFs are that they allow for a lot more diversification which can smooth out some of the speed bumps that you will eventually hit.  I have thousands of shares in probably 50 or 60 different stocks or ETFs and I still use ETFs to increase safety in some sectors or industries that I am not knowledgeable enough to stock pick.
I also have the advantage of size over a small account as I can add income to the mix by selling options.  You have to have 100 share lots to sell covered calls and be able to buy 100 share lots when selling puts.
So, to start... buy a few very safe dividend champion stocks and study the companies, watch the financial reports.  Continue to build that stock list so that when you have funds available and the market has dropped, you can step in and buy some... you do not want to be in a buy position and not have a stocks already picked just waing for that opportunity.

Second, you can see right here how the share price is lagging the return on equity metrics. Your graphs aren't aligned right, but if you move it forward, you'll see that the share price is reactionary. Clearly, these incredible Wall Street analysts were incorrect about the company's ROE even <1 year out. Did management project poorly, or was this irrational analyst expectations? Could a value investor taking the time to examine the company's position in the market have deduced that performance would weaken?

Finally, ROE is a terrible metric. Why would the share price go up? Maybe they paid off a ton of debt and are spinning out more FCFE today than in 2014? Maybe the valuation is really low, and your cash flow yield is 8%+ on a company in a commodities space, expecting growth at 3% next fiscal. IDK, I didn't look at the company.

82,Value Investing Lens and Where To Live. Which cities (US) give you Good value?,9.0,"Which US cities would you say give you a good value? 

I know this is a non-stock thread. I've been working on a personal project for a while now to analyze which cities offer the most ""bang for the buck"". I have been trying to use value investment ideas to find a good location to move to. (Basic assumption: a young 20-30 year old American male or female with a general Bachelor's degree wants to move to a place to improve their financial well being from a high CoL place such as NYC). Does anyone have any advice, insight, or tips in analyzing this idea? 

Value investing is believing something's intrinsic worth is out of tune with current market conditions. For a city, that is more tricky and subjective to pin down than a stock. But my thinking is that there are clear metrics you can use to at least get an idea of if a place might be a good proposition or not. For sure, there's huge subjectivity involved in any final moving decision. But that doesn't mean everything is just ""up in the air"" regarding value. You can get a sense of some good areas by just sifting through data.

To try to figure out cities that might be 'good deals', I looked at a wide variety of metrics, along with some subjective and less easily quantifiable factors. Similar to stock investing, this is half science and half art. Some things that were important to my thought process were: 1) Per capita income, 2) Median Home price, 3) Average rent, 4) Crime/safety, 5) Transit, 6) Anticipated future demand, 7) Importance of location, 8) People, 9) General state of economy, 10) Various proxies like rates of depression by state, etc. The single 2 most important metrics for me were median home price and per capita income. 

This is a list I made (tentative) of top undervalued cities in the US. Obviously any list like this will be open to debate and subjective to some extent (otherwise, everyone would agree and nothing would be undervalued or overvalued). I would like if knowledgeable people could comment or have any suggestions of their own, or want to discuss further:
 
#4) Omaha, NE - Yes, ironically Buffett's own place ranks up there. A booming economy in a safe and affordable place. 

#3) Philadelphia, PA and surrounding area  - I am uncertain if it merits being on the list. It seemed to check some boxes as offering value relative to other northeastern cities. But might be 'value trap'. 

#2) Jacksonville, FL and surrounding area - Just a good location. Good weather, and a booming economy. North Florida will likely only increase in demand as the decades go by. 

#1) Chicago, IL and surrounding area - Simply by the numbers, this stands out as a clear winner. It's very hard to beat world-class amenities with nice, educated folks, all at a reasonable price in an enormously rich economy. Despite the crime, which is really focused only in certain areas that can be avoided, it's a good value for what you pay.","['IL', 'PA', 'FL', 'NE', 'US', 'NYC']",,

87,Value Investing Lens and Where To Live. Which cities (US) give you Good value?,,,"['US', 'GDP']",18.0,"Chicago is the 3rd richest city in the US by GDP and 14th in the world by GDP. It's not just some ""random city"" that can be compared to other midwestern and southern cities. The value that you get from living there is astronomical, considering that the home prices are very reasonable and incomes are high. 

It's not suffering. There's many, many businesses headquartered in Chicago. Look up the business history and economy of Chicago. It is incredible. 

I don't think you get I'm using statistics, not just random thought processes, to make this list.....look up the per capita income in Chicago, the minimum wage in Chicago, and then the median home price."

Been to Chicago, family there.  It’s nice in spots. Shitty in spot.ls like most cities. I can think of a lot of better places to live. Again depends on the career but I would never live there."
89,Value Investing Lens and Where To Live. Which cities (US) give you Good value?,,,['WA'],24.0,"Again what’s your career? Can you work remote? If Chicago has the jobs you need then yeah great lol 

I’d live in most cities on the west coast over Chicago. Seattle, Portland, Spokane, Tacoma all the suburbs of those offer great “value”. Bend Oregon. Bellingham WA. 

I’m not sure what “value” you’re getting living in the one of the most dangerous cities in the country. Lmao

Any small town is going to offer more “value” than Chicago. But you probably don’t want to live there."
