Good Margins, increases in most of the important line items. April 24, 2024 News release states that they have a new office in Odessa, Texas, targeting the Permian Basin. (Great for their Industry) .\n\nThere website is pretty nice, for a company's stock price that trades pretty low. The website is easy to navigate and presented very clean. I haven't seen much of anything to hate on yet. I think the company looks good. Haven't taken a deep dive, surface level speaking, looks good. DFCF 3.22 in 5 years. Modest growth rate 3.26% and discount rate using WACC 7.4%.\n\n-EFP",

I'm newish to really researching and investing... have read 100 Baggers based on rec's here, and next is Dhando Investor. \n\nMy portfolio is currently mostly based on quantitative research... using a value factor + momentum (see What Works on Wall Street); I've been fine-tuning those strategies, but those are less research intensive. \n\nBut, after reading 100 Baggers, I got interested in the idea of having a few picks that I hold much longer... so, in general, I'm looking for Small or Micro-cap stocks, with a decrease in debt for the last three + years, and a increase in Free Cash Flow, good ROIC, a solid ownership interest, and still some decent value (below median PE, PS, EV/EBITDA). \n\n100 Baggers emphasized growth potential, and that's one issue I'm still trying to learn how to spot... at least some spending on R&D seems like a decent start.  \n\nThree stocks I've picked based on those ideas... all have those criteria above. \n\nELTK - Eltek L.t.d.\n\nBELFB - Bel Fuse Inc.\n\nITRN - Ituran Location and Control Ltd. \n\nWould love to hear anyone's thoughts on those as I'm learning more on the buy and hold long term strategy.

If you branch out into a new sector, how long does it take you to conduct enough research that you feel comfortable accurately making reasonable projections and time horizons? I can\u2019t help but feel everyone\u2019s zone of competence to actually make projections is so small. How many industries is the average person *really* an expert in. \n\nMy best investment was PLNT. I had been to dozens of different chains of gyms around the world at this point and knew the value prop was absurdly good and had talked to about 6 individual store operators to get a feel for how customers liked the franchise. Also did a ton of research on previous and comparable gym franchises and the history there. That\u2019s really the only reason I felt comfortable making projections. They had basically a 100% success rate of profitability for individual stores if you took out cases of actual fraud or embezzlement. Among the best profitability of any franchise, and the company itself has an excellent model with forcing equipment turnover and then vertically integrating those parts of the supply chain as well. \n\nWas valued at under 30 at the time, I valued it around 76 with a traditional DCF. I looked at previous store growth per year, estimated number of stores until market saturation, assumed management was being overly optimistic by 50%, and then just baked all these assumptions into the model.\n\nEnded up taking profits from 30ish to 70ish twice. I sold when I hit my target value because I figured no more profits to be had unless there was a material change in information like expanding into a new continent. I then looked at everything again when it dropped below 40, saw nothing changed, and again bought and held til mid 70s. \n\nDid I miss anything here? Is it really just about making your own reasonable assumptions and baking them into projections in a model and then just sticking to your guns and selling when it hits your valuation?\n\nI ended up becoming a software engineer instead but the thing I really don\u2019t get about the profession is, after a few months of research, what if you find the company is actually not undervalued? What if you\u2019re covering a sector so mature that basically everything is mostly correctly valued? Do you just look bad to your firm and LPs for a time and just suck it up?\n\nWhat about price manipulations by market makers? It would appear the big firms can just manipulate prices at will with algos, how do you know your value pick isn\u2019t getting caught up in that?",

Stock picking is not easy, I think key is to stay invested and continual learning.  If you didn\u2019t pick an absolute dud, you might not get 10% of the index but got 7% say, is it so bad?  If you didn\u2019t beat the index this year but you learn something, maybe it will allow you to beat it in the next decade.  So think what you want to pursue.  Did I beat the index every year?  No\u2026 did I beat it in the last 18?  Yes!\n\nIn fact, even Buffett often don\u2019t pick the best stocks, but he picked the good enough.

Worse yet, numbers can be manipulated, so this also needs to go into your thinking.  Example, re your BV, you have to make sure that it is indeed a true BV, maybe some things on the balance sheet needs to be revalued, maybe some overvalued etc.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. ok, as above, answered.\n2. It's not that DCF is useless, it has little 'advantage' in the sense that it's not the be all and end all to investing that it's cracked up to be.  A lot of people think I spend time to build my DCF then now I have this tool that will make me a bucket of gold.  My point is, if you can do a DCF in the 1950s, your edge is high, you try doing a DCF with no excel.  A DCF is fundamentally sound, but it's all based on your assumptions, are you going to build a DCF for a company that you don't like?  So from the get go, there is alot of positive bias in your assumptions.  I evaluate companies from all different angles, P/E, DCF, charts, call transcripts you name it, but the one thing I think is most important is the business model, how they make money, what are the pros and cons of their business model?  In this day and age, information is no longer an edge, so the edge is how you can think through all this information, how will the company behave, and how market react to it etc.\n3. This is just my view, the way things are going, eventually there will be one market, the US market.  Why?  They get the best valuations, and all the best companies go there to gain access to capital.  I mean, currently it is pseudo-single market, as their size is like 80% or something.  Similar European companies if listed in US will double in valuation instantly.  I invest in EU also, selectively, so never say never, every region have their gems.",

The investment company will still take indirect fees in the form of salary to employees in the company. Would this not make an investment company an inefficient holding?

You refer to investment company, I presume you mean something like funds?  Either way in this case the terms can be interchangeable.

If you look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it holds 30 stocks (price weighted), you line that up with the S&P500 (market cap weighted), they not that different.  So basically you put 30 stocks together in any form of weighting, you roughly will get market return.\n\nSo short answer, I don\u2019t believe in diversification as an investor (but it does take a lot of time, error, learnings and money lost to get to a certain confidence level), so it\u2019s almost always better to replace your own idea holding with an investment company/fund for any serious investor.",

What you are willing to pay is rather personal, there is no definitive right or wrong, but probabilistically, some valuations are safer than others, that's all.\n\nI never invest in a company that is not making money.  No earnings but growing revenues, and it will eventually make money, yes sure, but not for me.  However, to answer your question, I will gauge as revenues grow, what happens to the earnings??  It's not always that earnings grow, those I will be weary.\n\nDecrease revenues for a quarter or two, a lot of people seem to be very worried about this.  I guess it is not without reason, but I will say this, most analysts or even investors have NEVER ran a business themselves, if you ran a business, you will realise this every quarter goes up type of mentality is crazy.

Like say for example, if you knew there was a reason for a bull market 2020 vibe and you knew that AI companies would be the next dot com, crypto-type feel, then it would make sense to create a portfolio of businesses in that sector that is diversified enough to mitigate the (mis)management risk that is typically found in newer, fast-growing companies. But if your financial situation was that you are an old money/generally risk avoiding person, then diversifying across different sectors makes sense.\n\nSometimes though, diversification doesn\u2019t make sense. But that\u2019s only in the case where you a) know a lot about the companies and its industries you are invested in and b) you know what you do know and what you don\u2019t know and you\u2019re always on the lookout for news that could affect its valuation. For this type of play, I find it that the only situation where this makes sense is if there is a catalyst/reason, where there is a clear timeframe. For example, shorting Zoom post-pandemic. It makes sense that people would wanna use it less. Coupled with macro factors, it doesn\u2019t make sense to diversify a play like this. But rather manage other post-covid plays similar to this.",

Publicly available for free:\n\nhttps://igyfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full_Collection_Nomad_Letters_.pdf\n\nNick Sleep is not only a legendary investor but also one of the best writers on the topic. His letters cover his investment theses on excellent companies that went on to crush the market, along with general notes on investor psychology, market sentiment cycles, and the like. His writing is also very funny. \n\nIn his letters he describes his journey from being almost strictly a \u201cdeep value\u201d investor to more focused on long term compounding machines, albeit at more expensive valuations. One of the earlier investments he describes was a cement company in Thailand with a valuation like 10x below versus the cost of constructing new cement plants in an asset-replacement-value analysis (i.e., deep deep value). \n\nOne of the most enlightening points for me was Sleep\u2019s discussion of the \u201csecond layer of competence.\u201d Focusing on a company\u2019s competitive advantage is one thing, but focusing on what factors will strengthen (or not) that competitive advantage over time is the next layer down. For instance, he identifies \u201cscale economics shared\u201d as one such model\u2014instead of the company keeping more profits via higher margins as it realizes economies of scale, the company gives some of the savings back to the customer via lower prices and whatnot, thus bringing the customer back and driving further economies of scale. That\u2019s Costco for you. He bought around $30-$40 at a PE of 15 in the mid-2000s. We all know where Costco sits now. \n\nNomad ultimately wound things down around 2013, because at that point the portfolio was basically just Costco, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway. Nick explained he wasn\u2019t really planning to do anything further besides holding these companies and sitting on his hands. So he returned the shares to the investors so they could do the same without paying his fees. Sleep\u2019s disdain of money managers is comical, but he stood by what he said about it the whole time. \n\nGreat read by a great writer with great insights into holy grail compounding investment strategy. My #1 recommendation to anyone who has a basic grasp on valuation and quantitative concepts but wants to learn more about qualitative analysis in long term investing.",

Often those controlling companies are rather opaque or private.    \n2) Many of them have a heavy exposure to the European market which has a number of current and long-term challenges, particularly some rather bad demographics for long-term issues.     \n3) A lot of world market value is tied up in software and IT hardware today.  There are large numbers of skilled European programmers, etc., but their tech companies do not have the same ability to raise capital or freedom to innovate that American and many Asian companies do.  The more we have benefits flowing asymmetrically to companies like these, the harder the time the entire European market will have.     \n4) European companies are frequently tied to higher currency risks than American companies.     \n5) All other things being equal, due to cultural issues, a dollar of investment in the average European publicly traded company is likely to have a lower return on investment than a dollar of investment in the average American publicly traded company.",

A few months ago the valuation gap was 60% which was a record. I don't think that much is justified. Historically I believe it was more like 20-25%, which sounds fairly reasonable.\n\nA good example is oil companies. Compare these two indexes tracking large cap oil USA vs. Europe\n\nhttps://www.msci.com/documents/10199/fac49a43-b980-45c5-a759-825d05d284cc\n\nhttps://www.msci.com/documents/10199/43f0da3c-a77f-45f7-9037-5a7a60184db5\n\nThe gap between the basic valuation metrics is very significant, but why? XOM is the largest oil company in the world, but SHELL, TTE, and BP are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. They're major global companies, operating in the same international environment as their US counterparts. They're not state owned. SHELL and BP are UK incorporated, the UK is very capitalist friendly. \n\nThe CEO of Shell recently said he might move their primary stock listing to NYSE, instead of LSE, because he believed that simply by changing the listing of the stock (absolutely nothing to do with the value of the company), the performance would improve. I think he's got a point, if Shell had been listed on NYSE for the past 20 years, it would have performed better.

The Shell example though I think is likely a rational one that may also interact with the behaviors of investors that are both rational and irrational.     \n\nHe is almost certainly correct that Shell would have performed better as a stock had their primary listing been on the NYSE over that time even though they had ADRs.     \n\nI have done brand work with the NYSE, Euronext, and Nasdaq.  There are a number of things that would favor performance on NYSE or Nasdaq over LSE and even more so over Euronext.  Liquidity is the number one factor.  NYSE is the most liquid market and Nasdaq is probably second.  Dark pools, an additional source of liquidity which also allow large trades without huge shifts in price, appear to be most active with stocks traded on NYSE and Nasdaq.   The regulatory regimes under which the markets and the stocks listed on them operate are more stringent and more deeply watched than other markets (though there is still great room for progress, and this doesn't affect Shell much differently than today given its existing ADR exposure).    \n\nThere are also effects from individual investors that do impact the marginal pricing.  It is still perceived as much easier to trade and definitely much easier to research stocks that are NYSE primary listed than listed on other markets.  The US also has the largest number of individual investors due to historical developments.  Their interest and the location also means that it is easier to get earned media in the US (and in many other places) if there is a NYSE listing.  That means more attention and more likelihood of sparking interest.  It has a cumulative effect that is considerable.",

He ascribed it to technology breakthroughs driving economic growth that triggered the bond/debt cycle as well.  Also US debt we've stacked on since Reagan came to office 1981, has really triggered need now for massive money printing to cover the rising debt service, so Janet Yellin has to issue 1 trillion a quarter now of bonds so more supply with not as much demand will push up rates as well. Now we may get a 1-2 yr recession, so at hint of that rates will fall and I will sell all BDCs to change to long Bond fund like Vanguards EDV, which will rise 30% for every 1% drop in 10yr rate, this worked well for me in Nov/Dec. \n\nFor now the plan has been working last 18 months, If rates flat to rising, BDCs, if falling, then either EDV or MREITs, like NLY/AGNC/STWD etc Doing this over last year, my emergency fund outperformed my SP500 , VOO.",

Just a few minor suggestions in general rather than anything specific - if you want\n- it\u2019s good that you have built this - and I say that more for your overall understanding of the process of evaluation \n- take the output from the DCF and valuation for what they are worth. There\u2019s no science but it should give you a good feel for what the could be worth. \n\n- It is fairly subjective and ultimately everyone will arrive at an answer that may look different. I don\u2019t know anything about Thyroxate Tech but was curious to see another valuation out there. I saw Simply Wall Street evaluated it as 75% overvalued - compared to 15%. This is where you need to see why assumptions you are building into the model compared to others \n\nIf you are looking to share the DCF tool - simpler it is better use it has. Yours look pretty neat but you have added balance sheets, income statement etc which have made the model a bit bulky and not everyone needs to see those financial statements when you share",

EBITDA with margin of 4.4% --- Increase of 250 bps\u00a0\n* Product Commerce segment net revenues reached $23.6 billion, growing 18% YoY\u00a0\n* Product Commerce segment adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion with a margin of 6.5%, an expansion of 350 bps YoY\u00a0\n* Developing Offerings revenue was $789 million, up 26% YoY\u00a0\n* Developing Offerings adj. EBITDA was negative $466 million, compared to negative $225 million in the prior year (107% increase in EBITDA loss)\u00a0\n* FCF of $1.8 billion\u00a0\n* WOW membership program had 14 million paid members at the end of 2023, an increase of 27% YoY\u00a0\n\n**Q1 2024 Update**\u00a0\n\n* Farfetch financials included from this Q and onward\u00a0\n* Inclusion of Farfetch, whose expenses include $58 million of onetime cost this quarter relating to the acquisition and subsequent restructuring activity. Net earnings decreased by costs of Farfetch consodilation\u00a0\n* MGMT also anticipate that Farfetch will reach close to positive adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of the calendar year.\u00a0\n* Product Commerce adj. EBITDA margin was 7.2%, in line with the thesis (Growing to 10%)\u00a0\n* Developing Offerings revenue grew 346% YoY (including Farfetch revenue). Excluding Farfetch = 143% YoY\u00a0\n* Developing Offerings adj. EBITDA was ($186) million / ($155) million \u2013 less Farfetch consolidation, compared to negative ($55) million to prior Q\u00a0\n* Net revenue per Product Commerce active consumer is (1%) less than Q1 2024. Constant curency net revenue per Product Commerce active consumer is 3% more than Q1 2024. Core e-commerce business is resilient to external pressure from chinese e-commerce companies\u00a0\u00a0\n* Bom Kim, CEO \\[Q1 2024 Earning Call, page 3\\]\u00a0 \u201c*That robust (revenue) growth was primarily driven by the increase in spend of all of our existing customer cohorts, even our oldest. Our Product Commerce active customers also grew 16% year-over-year. Newer customers naturally spend less, but their spend levels have followed the same trajectory of older customers over time. While new active customers were not the primary driver of this past quarter's revenue growth, the rising number of new active customers should contribute more to growth for the business in the years ahead*\u201d\u00a0\n* Cohort data in line with original thesis, if not better.\u00a0\u00a0\n* MGMT states CapEx spending will stay elevated for the upcoming years. Focus will be on market share gain, customer acquisition and revenue growth rather than profitability, which is in line with my expectations and right move in my opinion.\u00a0\n* 2024 adjusted EBITDA losses for Developing Offerings are expected to be around $750 million\u00a0\u00a0\n* **Conclussion**\u00a0\n\nEBITDA margin expansion of Product Commerce segment combined with organic growth of active users and WoW members in line with the thesis. Revenue, gross profit, FCF and EBITDA are correlating to the thesis. In one year, Coupang added nearly 3 million of active customers, and taking into consideration its cohort data, it will continue to grow its revenue and expand margins. The future seems in line with the base thesis expectations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDeveloping Offerings segment showed promising results aswell with its increasing revenue growth. Most of it can be atribuited to Coupangs Taiwan expansion (requires high CapEx spending).  For a next couple of years, this CapEx requirement will make Developing Offerings segment unprofitable.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNOTE 1: Q4 constant currency growth rates are few points below the reported ones! Lower +- 3%\u00a0\n\nNOTE 2: FY23 constant currency growth rates are actually higher than the reported ones.\u00a0",

        "post_body": "(Disclosure: I have a tiny position in cpng)\n\nArticle Link: [https://millervaluefunds.com/coupang-inc-cpng/](https://millervaluefunds.com/coupang-inc-cpng/)\n\nINSIGHTS\n\nCoupang Inc. (CPNG)\n\nBY: BILL MILLER IV, CFA, CMT\n\nAPRIL 18, 2024\n\nMarket Capitalization: $34.1B\n\nEnterprise Value: $31.7B\n\nPrice: $19.02 (4/9/24)\n\n**WHAT THE COMPANY DOES**\n\nDubbed the \u201cAmazon\u201d of Korea, Coupang is the leading e-commerce retail and logistics provider in the country. The company has over 100 fulfillment centers in Korea, with 70% of the nation living under 7 miles from a Coupang fulfillment center, enabling rapid delivery. In addition to selling owned inventory, Coupang sells advertising and goods from third-party merchants. It also provides restaurant ordering and delivery service through its Eats segment, while Coupang Play is a content-streaming service.\n\n**WHY WE OWN IT**\n\nCoupang is the leading player in a large addressable market with numerous growth levers at a compelling price. The company only holds a single-digit market share of Korea\u2019s commerce market, which is expected to grow at a 4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from $483B in 2023 to $563B in 2027. Active customers increased 16% in 2023 to 21MM customers, while revenue per active customer rose 6%, as active customers and revenue per active customer have grown at CAGRs of 16% and 18%, respectively, between 2019 and 2023. International expansion is also ramping, as Coupang\u2019s revenues and customers in Taiwan more than doubled in the last two quarters of 2023, with management adding that the growth and level of adoption witnessed so far in Taiwan exceeds what was seen in Korea. Additionally, management believes it can leverage prior insights from experience in Korea to scale profits more quickly in Taiwan. Further scaling of the logistics business, which doubled volumes in 4Q23 and grew participating merchants 80% over the prior year\u2019s quarter, should also eventually serve as a margin tailwind when excluding abnormally high new merchant acquisition costs. Management expects annual Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion going forward, building off a company record margin of 4.4% in 2023, aiming to achieve 10% or higher over the long term, with similar levels of free cash flow.\n\nShares appear relatively inexpensive versus e-commerce peers (AMZN, MELI, BABA, ETSY, EBAY, SE, JD, and Naver) given CPNG\u2019s superior growth profile, as analysts are forecasting CPNG to grow Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) at a 35.1% CAGR from 2023-2026, more than double the peer group median\u2019s expected growth. CPNG trades at a forward (FY25 consensus) Enterprise Value/Sales (EV/Sales) multiple of 1.0x, a 55% discount to the peer group median multiple, and a level that historically marked a bottom for Amazon.\n\n**HOW MANAGEMENT ALLOCATES CAPITAL**\n\nManagement follows a disciplined capital allocation approach, opting to invest only when they have conviction that the potential opportunities can reach meaningful scale with moat-like returns. The top priority remains investing in organic growth and market share by delivering moments of \u201cwow\u201d for customers. CPNG has a low-risk balance sheet with cash exceeding total debt by nearly $2.5B, which, along with ramping free cash flow, should provide ample funding for the company\u2019s future operational needs as well as financial flexibility for opportunistic M&A. CEO Bom Kim is a value-creator and heavily aligned with shareholders, owning over 10% of the company.",

Taiwan is interesting to watch. They retreated from Japan earlier and I think it was a good learning for them. \n\n2. The giants here in Asia are Shoppee, PDD/Temu, Alibaba/Lazada/Taobao. Coupang\u2019s main competitive advantage is the same as Amazon: same day delivery, which is something the other guys won\u2019t do because of price. \n\nTo maintain this edge, CPNG has its fleet of drivers not unlike Amazon, versus the competition. \n\n3. My only reservation for not investing more in this company is that in Asia, there will always be someone crazy enough to lose money for market share. Shoppee has the greatest to lose In Taiwan and SE Asia. \n\n4. My valuation is all over the shop:\n\n- using a blended approach, I get an iv of $22 -23\n- using analyst nos for year 1-5, and using my blended growth rates, I get a what I call \u201cPlan-B\u201d DCF IV of 23.62 which is close enough for m* \u2018s 24. \n\nThese valuations assume eps growth of 10.7 to 12 % a year for next 10 years. This is certainty achievable, although their acquisition of \u201cFarfetch\u201d will mask the profitability somewhat.",

He and his team employed trading algorithms and artificial intelligence to outperform the market\u2014and the likes of\u00a0[Warren Buffett](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/warren-buffett)\u00a0and\u00a0George Soros. Later, Simons became a political donor and an influential philanthropist in the worlds of science, health and education.\n\nSimons, the son of a Boston shoe-factory executive, developed an early passion for mathematics and ignored the advice of the family physician who urged him to steer clear of the field because he wouldn\u2019t make a living. The warning proved misplaced.\n\nSimons began his career as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. He proved popular with students. One year, Simons amused a graduate class by confessing that he didn\u2019t know much about the topic\u2014partial differential equations\u2014but that he viewed teaching the course as a good way to learn.\n\nSimons became restless, though. He started businesses with friends and dabbled in trading.\u00a0Friends and family detected a desire for wealth.\n\n\u201cJim understood at an early age that money is power,\u201d said Barbara Simons, his first wife, in an interview. \u00a0\n\nDuring the Cold War, in 1964, Simons joined\u00a0a U.S.\u00a0intelligence organization fighting the Soviet Union. He successfully broke Russian code but was fired when he took a public stance against the Vietnam War, upsetting his boss, who had spoken in favor of the war.\n\nSimons joined Stony Brook University in Long Island, N.Y., where he ran the math department, developing an ability to recruit talented professors. At 37, he won geometry\u2019s highest honor, cementing his reputation in the world of mathematics. His Chern-Simons theory remains one of the most widely cited math papers of the past century.\n\n# Farewell to academia\n\nIn 1978, at the age of 40, Simons astonished his colleagues by quitting academia to try his hand at trading. He started an investment firm in a dreary Long Island strip mall, next to a women\u2019s clothing boutique and two doors from a pizza joint. At the time, many rivals were \u201cfundamental\u201d investors, chatting with corporate managers, scrutinizing balance sheets and relying on judgment and intuition to predict the ups and downs of investments.\n\nWhere others saw the zigs and zags as chaos, Simons, who had been trained to scrutinize large data sets, sensed that financial markets had more structure than most presumed.\n\n\u201cI developed a view that markets are not random, and \\[were\\] to some extent predictable,\u201d he later said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThere were statistical anomalies that could be exploited.\u201d\n\nEarly on, Simons traded like most others, reading the news and betting on gold prices and other investments. He scored gains but found it hard to endure the market\u2019s volatility. He developed stomach pains and berated himself for miscues.\n\n\u201cOne day you\u2019re a genius, the next you feel like a dope,\u201d Simons said. \u201cFundamental trading gave me ulcers.\u201d\n\nSimons set out to build an automated trading system that could discover fleeting and overlooked patterns in prices.\n\n\u201cI want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons told a friend at the time. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired scientists and mathematicians who used data going back centuries, predictive algorithms and machine learning. They often met with frustration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pattern here; there\u00a0*has*\u00a0to be a pattern,\u201d Simons insisted one day.\n\nAt one point, their trading system inadvertently came close to cornering the market for Maine potatoes, to the dismay of regulators.\n\n\u201cWe were viewed as flakes with ridiculous ideas,\u201d said Elwyn Berlekamp, who helped lead the firm in the 1980s, in a 2017 interview.\n\n# A payoff, finally\n\nBy 1990, Simons and his team, in their East Setauket, N.Y., headquarters, had identified ways to profit from currency, commodity and other markets using short-term patterns they had found. It took years longer, but the\u00a0firm, by then called Renaissance Technologies, eventually discovered a way to make billions of dollars on stocks.\n\nTheir winning strategy: holding investments for short periods, even minutes, turning almost all of the trading decisions to computers\u2014and maintaining a veil of secrecy unlike almost any in Wall Street\u2019s history. Colleagues said one reason for the firm\u2019s success was Simons\u2019s ability to coax accomplished mathematicians and scientists to join his firm, and get them to work together\u2014his genius was managing genius.\n\n\u201cThere is one GOAT \\[greatest of all time\\]. His name was Jim Simons,\u201d said\u00a0Clifford Asness, managing and founding principal of AQR Capital Management. \u201cThat he was also a nice, kind, generous and caring man just makes it that much more amazing.\u201d\n\nBetween 1988 and 2018, Renaissance\u2019s flagship\u00a0Medallion Fund\u00a0produced gains of more than $100 billion and average annual returns of 66% before the firm\u2019s unusually hefty investor fees. The annual gains were 39% after those fees, a performance that topped those of\u00a0[Buffett](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/warren-buffett), Soros,\u00a0Peter Lynch\u00a0and other investors during that period. Medallion years ago became a fund only open to Simons and his colleagues.\n\nSimons defied the odds in other ways. He was a regular cigarette smoker, lighting up in office buildings, restaurants and most everywhere else. Once, during a presentation to potential clients, Simons couldn\u2019t find an ashtray so he buried his cigarette butt deep in a sheet cake, amazing his guests.\n\n# Many converts\n\nToday, more investors have embraced Simons\u2019s mathematical, computer-oriented approach. About one-third of all money is managed by so-called quant firms, and businesses in various industries rely on algorithms.\n\nAway from trading, Simons suffered tragedy. One son, Paul, died in a bicycle accident. Another, Nicholas, died while scuba diving.\n\n\u201cMy life is either aces or deuces,\u201d Simons once told a colleague.\n\nOver the years, Simons reduced his role at the firm while focusing on science, education and other philanthropies. In 2010 he resigned as Renaissance\u2019s chief executive, yielding the job to longtime employee and former\u00a0[International Business Machines](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IBM)\u00a0computer scientist\u00a0Peter Brown. Simons retired as chairman in 2021.\n\nSimons\u2019s health had deteriorated recently.\n\nSimons gave away more than $6 billion during his lifetime. The Simons Foundation became a leading private funder of research in basic science. Simons also provided annual stipends of $15,000 to more than 1,000 top math and science teachers in New York City. He funded efforts to discover treatments for autism and spent $75 million to build an observatory in Chile to gain an understanding of creation\u2019s earliest moments.\n\nIn 2021, Simons and senior Renaissance executives\u00a0[agreed to pay up to $7 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-simons-robert-mercer-others-at-renaissance-to-pay-7-billion-to-settle-tax-probe-11630617328?mod=article_inline)\u00a0to settle a long-running tax probe related to how the firm converted short-term gains into long-term profits, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. It was one of the biggest settlements in Internal Revenue Service history.\n\nSimons was one of the biggest backers of Democratic candidates, supporting the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and\u00a0Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile,\u00a0Robert Mercer, then the co-CEO of Renaissance, in 2016 became one of then-presidential-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s most important backers.\n\nIn a 2019 speech, Simons offered a life lesson to MIT students.\n\n\u201cBe guided by beauty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be a way a company runs, or the way an experiment comes out, or the way a theorem comes out, but there\u2019s a sense of beauty when something is working well, almost an aesthetic to it.\u201d\n\nSimons is survived by his wife,\u00a0Marilyn Simons, and three children. His earlier marriage to Barbara Simons ended in divorce.",

Apart from that, isn't unity a nice stock that fits into our society/economy with semi good fundamentals? I feel like the stock is insanely oversold right now only based off speculation and its at all time lows. \n\nPlease tell me your opinions.

Unreal has been gaining traction over the past few years and has been taking a lot of the AAA market for games, and this has accelerated in 2023 when Unity announced their new pricing model. Unity seems to struggle with implementing a lot of the new sexy features that Unreal has aced.\n\nHowever, Unity is the superior platform for mobile games, and I don't think they will lose clients any time soon as the big studios using Unity are unlikely to change over, particularly when Unreal 5.4 has just announced a new pricing model as well. A lot of developers are familiar with Unity and I imagine they will continue to make games using the software for a long time.\n\nI think Unity will probably go up or down with the industry itself and will be resilient, and the games industry is currently ebbing.",

        "post_date": "2024-05-10T13:45:18",
        "post_body": "I run a small hedge fund based out of Raleigh, NC. Myself and my Fund are long $HAYPP. Please see the disclaimer at the bottom of the post. For more blog posts like this check out my Fund's blog at [https://www.rogue-funds.com/blog](https://www.rogue-funds.com/blog) \n\nAlso if you would like to see this blog post with pretty pictures you can also check out: [https://www.rogue-funds.com/blog/haypp-group](https://www.rogue-funds.com/blog/haypp-group)\n\n*All Financial Figures are in USD unless otherwise specified.*\n\nI think HAYPP Group, the biggest online retailer of nicotine pouches, can capture a huge chunk of the sales in what I believe will be the biggest form of nicotine intake growth over the next 10-15 years.\n\nThe future of nicotine consumption will be nicotine pouches and it is growing at an unprecedented rate. Here in the States the go to item for nicotine pouches are Zyn\u2019s (owned by Philip Morris), in Europe it\u2019s Velo (owned by British American Tobacco), but there are various other brands that all catching fire: ON! (Altria), Rogue, Juice Head, FRE, Lucy, and Sesh, among various others.\n\n**What is HAYPP?**\n\n*Brief History*\n\nHAYPP is an online retailer and distributor of nicotine pouches and snus. The company was started by a couple of Swedish teenagers in 2009 and through mergers and acquisitions they no longer are in charge of the company as the current CEO joined in 2017/2018. The company bought Nicokick.com and northerner.com (northerner owns 9% of stock) which are now both of their main American brands. They switched from Snus to Nicotine Pouches 6 years ago and haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nHAYPP currently owns a roughly 85% online market share for their Nordic part of the business, which they refer to as their \u201ccore\u201d business as well as a \\~55% market share of the oral nicotine market (85% market share of the *legal* nicotine pouch e-commerce market) for their growth market which is considered the US, UK, Germany, and Swiss countries.\n\n*SEO Powerhouse*\n\nSo how do they have such a grasp on what would obviously be a hyper competitive online industry? The main reason for their hyper success in the online market is that they have a death grip on the SEO landscape. Their mastery of SEO allows them to spend almost nothing on marketing and to keep pushing out their distribution system (which continues to drive costs down for them and consumers). This creates a positive feedback loop as they become even cheaper than their competitors, allowing them to lock in customers (over 90% of the customers becoming recurring customers). \n\nIf you google just about anything related to Nicotine pouches, there is probably a 95%+ chance that the top unpaid search result will be a HAYPP Group Domain. Even niche searches such as \u201cwhat is an upper decky\u201d (Gen. Z slang for nicotine pouches) or basic searches such as \u201cwhat are the top nicotine pouches\u201d you will see that HAYPP Group owns the top of the search.\n\nThis is huge when sites like Google severely limit the amount of advertising that addictive products can utilize on their search engine. HAYPP ends up barely spending anything on marketing due to 40% of new customers coming through word of mouth and the rest from SEO.\n\n*Data*\n\nTheir other field of expertise is data collection and selling. Due to the large variety of pouches and being the number one online seller of nicotine pouches, they have created a major database which they sell to various nicotine pouch producers such as Philip Morris and Altria. Producers buy these on an annualized basis, and you can see the usage of their data among the investor relation reports/presentations/websites of various producers. As you can see from my beautiful pictures on this post, they compile plenty of data to help me understand the business better.\n\n*Lowest Cost Seller and Best E-Commerce Distribution*\n\nDue to their distribution network, HAYPP has become one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) sellers of nicotine pouches in the world. You can buy Zyn\u2019s cheaper from HAYPP websites than you can from the ZYN website. Haypp\u2019s prices are 20-40% cheaper than grocery stores and 30-50% cheaper than convenience stores. \n\nThey have been integrating their distribution network so that most variable costs are being converted to vertical fixed costs creating operating leverage for them as they rapidly scale their revenue and are able to increase margins. They have implemented 2-day delivery across the US and close to implementing across Europe markets as well.\n\n*Leveraging Market Share for High Quality New Products*\n\nThe last part of their business model is their ability to leverage their large consumer base to help new products capture market share, which allows them to capture higher margins on their products and it increases the variety of products which consumers would like to buy. In Nordic countries the variety of products is a benefit to them as consumers want to try various brands and flavors. When this competition trend hits the US it will only benefit them even more.\n\n**Why Haypp vs Pouch Companies**\n\nCurrently in the US there are only a couple main brands with Zyn owning a huge chunk of the market. In Europe, Velo is the most popular brand but there are many Nordic brands that consistently attack margins and currently there is little competition in the US market which most likely won\u2019t last much longer. As consumers search out the cheapest product and try to hunt for variety, HAYPP will be that future as convenience stores lag in variety and cost.\n\nProducts such as Zyn will definitely continue to grow (currently Zyn is growing at 70% y/y) but we could see margins shrink as competition becomes fiercer and consumers branch out away from the first movers, although Zyn continues to take up 70% of the US market. This only further benefits HAYPP as they are the go-to spot for a large amount of variety. Although they don\u2019t benefit as much from less competition, they are still beneficiaries of an oligopoly esque market due to their cost and distribution networks.\n\nMost large publicly traded pouch companies are also cigarette and chewing tobacco sellers who are rapidly seeing those segments get cannibalized by vaping and nicotine pouches combined with regulatory crackdown risk. Since HAYPP has no exposure to either one, you will not experience any cannibalization outside of snus cannibalization in the Nordics. This is the best pure play bet on nicotine pouch consumption.\n\nCertain countries have limited the ability for consumers to have access to nicotine via retail stores which will allow them to take huge shares of the overall market in places like Germany or in California where they have banned flavored nicotine products in retail stores has led to windfall of customers to HAYPP\u2019s e-commerce model.\n\n**Management**\n\nThe current CEO of HAYPP group, Gavin O\u2019Dowd, used to work for British American Tobacco (BAT) and was the driving force for the VELO acquisition. He currently owns 3.6% of the stock and various other PE firms and Family Offices own large chunks of HAYPP. Most executives have warrants that could give them the right to 200k-400k shares each (29m shares outstanding with no serious history of dilution).\n\n**Regulations**\n\nAs many of you are aware, regulations are a huge part of the nicotine industry. Taxes are going to be huge risks, which are then combined with flavor bans. I think nicotine pouches are one of the products that are least likely to get hit with serious bans since their health risk is much lower than almost any other nicotine product. \n\nThe nicotine pouch industry as a whole has been behaving spectacularly well when it comes to ensuring they are not purposefully marketing to young people. They are trying to avoid having a Juul 2.0 fiasco which basically murdered that business and completely fragmented the vaping industry which is on the brink of regulatory crack down.\n\nHAYPP does their part by ensuring age regulation across their whole site. They have age verification to order and deliver. They have a huge emphasis on ensuring that they abide by the law.\n\n**Financials**\n\n*Core Segment (Nordic Countries)*\n\nThe company is growing heavily in every segment that it operates in. Its core segment seems to be slowing down in growth due to heavy cannibalization from snus sales. This should only be temporary as nicotine pouch volume grows at 30%+ y/y. Once snus nears its cannibalization endpoint, I would expect revenue to begin growing again in its core market (although not at 30%). Current revenue is $250m USD and EBITDA is about $18m USD for just the core segment for the last twelve months. Management expects high single digit EBITDA margins for 2025.\n\n*Growth Segment (US, UK, Germany, Switzerland)*\n\nThe growth segment is skyrocketing. Growth is over 46% y/y and this growth has been consistent and should continue to be consistent. EBITDA margin for the growth markets has begun to inflect positively which will cause a massive amount of leverage in their EBITDA to occur as their fixed cost model begins to do its job. As economies of scale drive forward, we should see this margin increase substantially over the coming years. Currently Revenue is at $77m USD for growth markets and EBITDA is at -$3.5m USD.\n\n*Let\u2019s Talk about the Growth Segment a bit more.*\n\nThis is where the real value from HAYPP will come into play. While it currently begins to inflect positive in terms of profitability, it should be noted that the Growth markets have a massive TAM compared to their core market and could cause the company to 5x in the next few years if they maintain or gain market share and continue to grow in these massive TAMs.\n\nAs they grow, their competitive advantage deepens due to sticky customers and cheaper products from economies of scale. The US has an even faster scale of 49%+ growth y/y and HAYPP is outpacing the US nicotine pouch growth at 57% y/y. As the US begins to approve various products and variety begins to flood the US market, a ton of US users want to try various Nordic brands that don\u2019t have access which lends a very strong lean towards an online website such as HAYPP. The US is a very ripe environment along with the UK and Germany (where nicotine can only be sold online) for HAYPP to continue to outperform massively.\n\n*Emerging Segment*\n\nTheir \u201cemerging\u201d segment is where they have begun to introduce vapes into their value chain. HAYPP is beginning to sell vapes to UK and Germany, but it is at the very beginning stages and has no current significant impact on their bottom or top line. The company says the growth they are experiencing in this segment has been very similar to the growth that they experienced when they introduced Nicotine Pouches in growth markets. This is the most likely segment to get hit with regulatory concerns, so for now I won\u2019t even consider this in a to be a profitable unit and will just assume it will be a small drain on EBITDA for the foreseeable future.\n\n*Balance Sheet*\n\nThe balance sheet is great with no large debt burden and good working capital management. As they hit profitability this year/early next year I would expect a cash build up until the company decides if they will be returning cash to shareholders or reinvesting in the business. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nHAYPP is extremely undervalued based on where they are from a profitability standpoint and their current inflection point. Due to their high growth, it will be hard to pinpoint an exact value on them so this will merely be an exercise in estimating their value among a range more than usual (anyone who claims they can perfectly value a high growth company is probably overvaluing due to unsound conviction).\n\n\u00a0First let\u2019s look at how they are currently valued, which is roughly 14x their **core** EBITDA. Now let\u2019s take a second and think about how insane that statement was. Their core market is the Nordic countries which will be hitting growth again as their snus cannibalization slows, the Nordic countries basically have no further regulation risk for nicotine pouches, and it is a noncyclical industry. I would argue that 14x their core EBITDA is probably an appropriate valuation based on **only** their core segment. \n\nWhat this means is (if you haven\u2019t noticed already) that you are getting their \u201cgrowth\u201d segment for **free** based on the valuation of the stock. The growth segment alone is probably worth multiples of the current stock price due to the massive TAM and extreme growth prospects. If we assume the emerging segment is worthless (which it isn\u2019t and it will be profitable at some point) then that means all of the upside in the stock can be based on what the value of the growth segment. Based on TAM, growth, and lack of cyclicality then this leaves the only risk as regulation. \n\nThere will most likely be some sort of regulation, but we are very far from that as the Tobacco industry has been very careful in how they implement their new nicotine pouch momentum in a more appropriate way compared to vapes. The most likely regulations will probably be flavor bans of some sort or retail bans (which further benefits HAYPP). Regulations will most likely be limited in scope due to just the sheer lack of mortality risk associated with pouches vs any other form of common nicotine intake.\n\nBased on their probable conservative revenue growth (40% average for the next 3 years, and 15% after that), EBITDA growth, the fact that they will have both core and growth markets at high single digit EBITDA margins in 2025, and their lack of cyclicality, then I would estimate that their Growth markets are worth a very conservative $400m-$500m USD. I am likely undershooting the valuation because they are driving profitability very fast and their revenue is growing closer to 40%-60% in growth markets right now. If they are able to keep up current growth figures and expand to double digit margins before the end of the decade then they could be worth 2x-3x this value (which is why valuing growth companies are so hard, because I can\u2019t foresee the future). Again, I valued the emerging segment as worthless which is unlikely as well. \n\nSo, based on the value of $450m USD for the growth markets and the current value of $240 USD for the Nordic markets, that would create a sum of the parts equal to roughly $700m or nearly triple the current share price. This valuation leaves a ton of room for margin expansion and higher growth prospects because let\u2019s face it, the US alone is probably worth at least 3x-5x more than the Nordic countries not including the UK, Germany, or Swiss. This is a very conservative valuation for the company, but it shows how great the risk/reward is based on the current price. Using a conservative valuation here also helps accommodate for regulation risk.\n\nIn SEK terms this would be 250 SEK/share or 7.35B SEK.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEven accommodating for regulation risk, a valuation of $700m seems appropriate as a starting point for the valuation for HAYPP Group. I think there is a very high likelihood that I could be off on this by a large margin, but I feel like the downside is very protected with this valuation. Management has been great in execution and I expect that to continue. In a more bullish case where every segment of the company fires on all cylinders we could see a valuation of $1.5B+, but that is not a scenario that I would like to bet my investors\u2019 money on. For now, I will stay invested and keep watching them execute and adjust my valuation accordingly.\n\n*Disclaimer: The author of this idea and his Fund have a position in securities discussed at the time of posting and may trade in and out of this position without informing the reader.*\n\n*Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

BTI (Velo, Lyft), MO (On!) and PM (Zyn) are focusing on diversifying away from classic tobacco products and the thesis is based on nicotine pouches being one of the more popular forms of nicotine intake vehiculums in the future. This would obviously have downward pressure on margins, and when I plugged in the lower margin rates in valuation model, the price did not look as attractive.\n\nI know Im being quite bearish, maybe for no valid reason since I did not put as much effort reasearching the company + market as you did.

        "post_body": "Even with market uncertainty, stocks have been largely resilient in recent weeks. We can thank a better-than-expected set of first-quarter earnings for that.\u00a0\n\n# Strong First-Quarter Earnings Drive Market Rally\n\nWith over 80% of companies in the [S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/)\n\ndone reporting their metrics, the benchmark index is slated to pace at a 5% growth rate for the first quarter in terms of earnings per share. This is the largest increase, year-over-year, since the second quarter of 2022. It's higher than the 3.2% growth analysis predicted prior to the start of the earnings season.\n\nBut one can say that this doesn\u2019t make any sense. Higher interest rates usually hurt U.S. stock valuations. Instead, the stock market seems to have a mind of its own, as strong Q1 earnings have done a great job supporting stocks even as lofty expectations and high rates raise the bar for what it takes to crack the market.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts are going so far as to say that the strong earnings growth is the primary factor driving the index\u2019s rally of over 8% so far this year and could even send stocks flying higher.\u00a0\n\nA large fact to support this claim is that company net profit margins are pacing at around 11.7% growth in the first quarter, which is above the five-year average of 11.5% growth and much higher than the same period a year ago. This is a great sign for the economy if you take away inflation and the Fed.\n\n# Cost-Cutting Strategies\u00a0Drive Market Rally\n\nWhy is this the case?\n\nIt's definitely not revenues. Cost-cutting has been the corporate trend for many companies, especially in Big Tech. In 2023, investors cheered as tech companies slashed payroll and other labor expenses to bring significant earnings growth for their companies. If revenue stays the same but costs go down, well, simple math can tell us that net income will increase for the company.\n\nLooking at how well thats worked for Big Tech, in 2024, companies outside of tech have tapped into this playbook themselves, setting up the rest of the index for strong earnings growth throughout the rest of the year, even if revenue didn't increase for the companies.\n\nThis could allow for a market rally many have called for, one in which non-tech companies within the S&P 500 are finally able to catch up to the Magnificent Seven technology stocks.\u00a0\n\n# Analyst Optimism for the Current Quarter\n\nSo far, analysts continue to remain optimistic about the current quarter. Oftentimes, analysts cut earnings forecasts as the quarter rolls along. This has not happened as of now.\n\nOver the first month of the second quarter, analysts have raised their earnings per share projects for the companies within the S&P 500 by an aggregate of 0.7%.\n\nCompared to the usual decline of 1.8% around this time in the past 20 years, this looks to be a great sign for the market and a major bullish development. It is hard to see US large caps falling when earnings estimate revisions are so positive. For the bears to win, a major market shock needs to come along, which is unlikely.\n\n*i like to think I'm a good guy, so I wanna give credit where it's due:*\u00a0[This analysis I got almost entirely from here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)",

In the first quarter this year, the burrito chain\u2019s same-restaurant sales growth surpassed nearly all fast-food companies, including McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s. Its stock is up 55% in the past six months.\n\nThree others\u2014burger joint Shake Shack, salad specialist Sweetgreen, and Cava Group, which serves Mediterranean-style bowls and pitas\u2014are expanding at a fast clip as they aim to replicate Chipotle\u2019s long-term success.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order for this trio, which will have to show that they can grow quickly and become more profitable. So far, they\u2019re making progress on both fronts: All three have been opening dozens of restaurants annually, most generating strong sales. By adopting new technologies, they are becoming more efficient and boosting the profitability of each store.\n\n. . . . . . . \n\nBy the end of 2023, Shake Shack, Sweetgreen, and Cava had 518, 221, and 309 locations, respectively. Wall Street expects all three to add at least 15% more restaurants in both 2024 and 2025. Sweetgreen aims to have 1,000 stores by 2030, while Cava expects to get there two years later. Chipotle has nearly 3,500 stores.\n\nIn 2023, Sweetgreen and Cava generated nearly $3 million in annual sales per store on average, not far behind Chipotle. Shake Shack has an even higher average of $4 million per domestic company-operated location. The challenge will be to maintain those levels as the companies scale.\n\nThe three have improved their restaurant-level profit margins, a measure of how efficiently a company is running its stores. Cava, approaching 25% in 2023, is the closest to Chipotle\u2019s 26%. Shake Shack and Sweetgreen are at 20% and 17%, respectively.\n\n. . . . ..\n\n",

The S&P 500, for example, has dropped 1.3% over the same period. The rally has brought Chinese stocks into bull-market territory: They have rebounded more than 20% from their January lows.\n\nThat is a stark turnaround after three straight years of losses. But investors have been burned by false starts before: The MSCI China index had surged 57% over three months starting in October 2022 on Covid reopening hopes, only to have most of those gains fizzle out as China\u2019s postpandemic recovery turned out to be anemic. \n\n. . . . .\n\nThe cheap valuations and the momentum of fund flows probably could keep the Chinese market going for a while.

The company was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nRevenue: I have never seen a more Impressive revenue chart. When I say \u201cimpressive\u201d I\u2019m not talking about the rate of growth, I\u2019m simply talking about the consistency of the revenue because this will showcase the company\u2019s ability to maintain revenues in different economic environments. So when we look at this it looks pretty resilient, then when we look at 2020 there is no noticeable impact on revenue whatsoever. This was shocking to me, even high quality compounding companies such as $MA and $V saw a meaningful drop in revenue. If you look at revenue per quarter you\u2019ll notice higher revenues in Q2 and Q3 every fiscal year due to $FTDR\u2019s A/C business. The rest of the resiliency in the business is due to their subscription model which I see as a huge advantage seeing as they have a 76% subscription renewal rate with 82% of all current subscribers being on autopay. The autopay factor is the bedrock of the revenue resiliency.\n\nFree Cash Flow: Apart from a one quarter drop in Q3 of 2022, the free cash flow also seems much like revenue in terms of its resiliency. I admit I would like to see more growth in FCF, however the biggest factor that influenced this lack of growth was the slowing housing market as Frontdoor gets most  of their warranty customers from real estate sales. Frontdoor boasts a FCF yield of 6.66% which I view as an attractive number.\n\n\nCash, Debt, and Capital Leases: Personally when I look for companies I look for minimal debt, capital leases I\u2019m normally indifferent to even though technically they are considered liabilities. Although Frontdoor does have a sizeable amount of debt compared to their cash pile, they have been constantly paying down this debt since Q4 of 2020. I suspect in the not too distant future their cash pile will surpass their total debt. Like I said before I\u2019m indifferent to Capital Leases as they\u2019re simply long term contracts and not pure bank debt.\n\nStock Repurchases: Frontdoor has been buying back stock since Q2 of 2021 and it\u2019s a trend I will continue to expect into the future. In 2021 Frontdoor announced a 3 year $400 Million share repurchase program which considering the market cap, is a significant repurchase program. \n\nReturn on Capital Employed: High ROCE is a necessity in the companies I look to purchase and $FTDR surpasses expectations with a 2023 ROCE of 40.11%. Normally I look for at least 20% so double that is fantastic. They have also maintained a high ROCE since 2016.\n\nConclusion: Obviously this is not a perfect company and it has many flaws but this information is just the tip of the iceberg and there\u2019s so much more important information but I do believe this company can still be a powerhouse compounder. Thank you.",

Most of the changes we have seen in the past 18 months or so began around 2013 with Abenomics, the economic policies introduced under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. These structural improvements included greater shareholder rights and returns, easing restrictions, better capital allocation, and ultimately increased corporate competitiveness, and were aimed at reviving the economy and making companies more efficient.\n\nSlowly, but steadily, we have seen improvement. In the first half of 2023, I became more positive, due to factors like progress on corporate-governance reforms, which were getting more recognition; activist firms making headlines in Japan; and signs of sustainable domestic inflation. My fear of stagflation eased as we moved into 2024 as wage negotiations gained even greater momentum.\n\nDespite all the positive changes, \\[Japanese stocks\\] haven\u2019t seen much of a rerating in the past 10 years. Company valuations are down to earth, while corporations are stronger than they had been, with leaner balance sheets. These are global companies, generating earnings across the world.\n\n. . . . . . \n\n**What are you investing in now?**\n\nI\u2019ve been a growth manager all my career, which was a sound move for many years. In 2022, we saw a sudden acceleration in inflation rates; I thought it was going to be transient, but over time I realized it wasn\u2019t, because it was fueled by things like higher import prices and labor shortages. With Japan\u2019s interest rates still close to zero, there is a big gap compared with the earnings yields of Japanese equities. But international investors are the main players in Japan, so you have to compare earnings yields of stocks to U.S. Treasuries.\n\nI knew I had to change my portfolio\u2014to what I call growth stocks in disguise. They are typically labeled as value, because they have been growing at mid-single to high-single digits. But as long as the business is growing at a faster rate than nominal world gross domestic product, that\u2019s growth to me.\n\nInsurance companies are growing at mid- and high-single digits, and in Japan there are only three listed players for general insurance and property casualty insurance\u2014 Tokio Marine Holdings, MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, and Sompo Holdings. We own all three, which control 90% of the market; I don\u2019t know of any other insurance market outside of Japan that has that kind of market-share concentration. As a result, they have strong pricing power and strong profitability.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s a sexy industry.\n\n**What do others think?**\n\nThe market thinks insurance is generally boring, so the stocks are labeled value stocks, with supercheap valuations. Because they are so cheap, if they provide good shareholder returns via buybacks and dividends, you get yields around 4% or 5%, and buybacks of 2% of shares outstanding every year. They can do that sustainably because they have cash-rich, asset-rich balance sheets.\n\nThe insurers own tons of stock of their corporate insurance clients, acquired in the 1960s to promote business relationships. Today, business relationships aren\u2019t based on equity holdings, so they have to get rid of the stocks, but they\u2019re sitting on almost $10 billion or more of unrealized gains \\[for companies with market caps of about $50 billion or $60 billion\\]. It is a significant war chest for them that they can liquidate every year or two\u2014to return to the shareholders or fund their overseas growth.\n\nIf you add up the companies\u2019 moves\u2014mid-single digit earnings growth, dividend yields of 4% to 5%, share buybacks that can cancel 2% of shares outstanding every year\u2014you get 10%-plus expected shareholder returns. That\u2019s almost comparable to pure growth names.\n\n**You own semiconductor stocks. What is the outlook?**\n\n  \n. . . . . . \n\n[](https://www.barrons.com/articles/japan-stock-market-economy-yen-hennessy-fund-1992658a?mod=hp_LEADSUPP_2)",

Here's an analysis of Robinhood's latest earnings!\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Suggested plays by AI\ud83e\udd16\n\n* Buy if you think:\n   * people will keep degenning into options & crypto\n   * interest rates will stay high and people will keep trading on margin\n* Sell if you think\n   * Note they did get a Wells Notice from the SEC which could affect their crypto revenue, their fastest growing segment of revenue\n   * there\u2019s an upcoming bear market, volumes will go down and Robinhood will make less\n\n\ud83d\ude80 To the Moon or Lost in Space? \ud83d\ude80\n\nRobinhood's latest earnings report is like a rollercoaster at the county fair \u2013 thrilling for some, nauseating for others. Buckle up degens, because we're about to unpack whether you should hodl or fold on the app that's been the gateway to financial YOLOing for many.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Let's Talk Numbers \ud83d\udcb0\n\nRobinhood's revenue shot up by a sweet 40%, making it rain with more dollars than a Dogecoin rally. Options trading is the VIP at this party, making up around 25% of total revenue. But hold onto your hats, because crypto just mooned with a 231% increase! Bitcoin may be the king, but surprisingly DOGE is the loyal second-in-command on Robinhood's platform.\n\nInterest is where it's at, with nearly 40% of revenue coming from it \u2013 think margin interest, the kind of passive income that makes you feel like you're in a hammock on a Tuesday.\n\n**And the big reason why earnings was so great**: operating expenses dropping by 51%. Weirdly, a lot of that is thanks to the founders who canceled some of their own stock, making SBC expenses dive faster than you can say \"market correction.\"\n\nOh and top of that, Gold subscribers are up 42% to 1.68 million.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 So why is Robinhood dropping like it\u2019s hot? \ud83d\udcc9\n\nWhen the closing bell rang, Robinhood's stock soared like it caught a second wind from a SpaceX booster. But in a plot twist sharper than a GameStop short squeeze, it nosedived over 3% today. So, what's the deal? Picture this: The SEC dropped a Wells Notice in Robinhood's lap, which is basically the regulatory version of \"we need to chat, ASAP\" for their crypto segment. It's like a dark cloud looming over their brightest revenue star.\n\nBut here's the real head-scratcher: despite the confetti-worthy earnings, Robinhood didn't serve up an amazingly optimistic future forecast you'd expect from such a performance. It's like finishing a marathon with a personal best and then saying you might take up competitive eating instead. Investors are craving that sweet, sweet optimism about continued degenning into options and crypto, but Robinhood's crystal ball seems a bit foggy. With no upgraded guidance to light the way, it's got the market wondering if this rocket ship is prepping for a stellar journey or just orbiting in uncertainty. \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcb8\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Crystal Ball Time \ud83d\udd2e\n\nIf you've got diamond hands for high interest rates and margin trading, then buying Robinhood could be your ticket to tendie town. But if you're getting cold feet thinking about a bear market and quieter trading floors, you might want to swipe left on this one.\n\nRemember, the Wells Notice is like a storm cloud on a sunny day, especially when crypto is bringing home the bacon. And with no shiny new outlook for the rest of the year, some investors are ghosting harder than a bad Tinder date.\n\nSo, are you in for the thrill of the ride, or are you cashing in your tickets at the prize booth? Whether you're buying a ticket to the moon or bracing for a potential crash landing, keep your eyes on the charts and your snacks at the ready. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc9\ud83c\udf7f\n\n---\n\nFound this helpful?

        "post_body": "Warren Buffett shares insights on the future of Berkshire Hathaway, the potential dangers of AI, and his timeless investment philosophy in the wake of Charlie Munger's passing.\r  \nThe era of Buffett and Munger is coming to an end. At Saturday 4th Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, a toned-down tone hung in the air as Warren Buffett, one of the world's richest men with $ 117 billion as personal wealth, addressed the future of the company, the dangers of unchecked technology, and the staggering question of what happens to their $182 billion war chest. Now alone at the helm, the billionaire investor faced questions head-on, addressing the company's future, its investment approach, and the complexities of a rapidly evolving world.\r  \nSeating next to Buffett this year, were vice chairs Ajit Jain, the head of Berkshire\u2019s insurance businesses, and Greg Abel, who runs all non-insurance businesses. They focused on addressing more technical aspects behind their respective operations. Greg is expected to replace Buffett when Buffett is no longer around and throughout the annual meeting provided a message of continuity and strong corporate culture.\r  \nBeyond the irreplaceable\r  \nBuffett dispelled any notion that Berkshire Hathaway's success hinges on individual figures. And as pointed out by Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations at Berkshire, Apple's continued dominance under the leadership of Tim Cook, who was in the audience together with the VIP, following the death of Steve Jobs, emphasizing that well-structured companies outlast any single leader. Berkshire is built on principles and a team that will ensure its continued success.\r  \nAI: Power and peril\r  \nThe Oracle of Omaha drew parallels between the rise of generative AI and the arrival of nuclear technology. Both, he stressed, are immensely powerful tools with the potential for immense good or catastrophic harm. \"History teaches us that we can turn anything into a weapon,\" Buffett warned, emphasizing the need for careful stewardship around revolutionary technologies. This metaphor represents a change from last year's more enthusiastic reaction to the emergence of AI unicorns.\r  \nBillionaire investor warns: AI could be worse than nuclear weapons\r  \nShareholders pressed hard on Berkshire's commitment to combatting climate change. Buffett and his heir apparent, Greg Abel, affirmed their support for responsible change, highlighting their investments in Iowa. However, they cautioned against reckless speed, stating that natural gas remains a necessary bridge fuel. \"Solar can't power the world alone,\" Buffett stated, advocating for a balanced, economically viable transition.\r  \nThe cash pile and Buffett's discipline\r  \nDespite Berkshire's staggering $182 billion in cash reserves, Buffett, with a net worth of $117 billion, emphasized that capital deployment will only happen when the right opportunities arise. Some Berkshire shareholders seemed less than satisfied, questioning how Buffett could justify sitting on such a vast sum. His response? \"We only swing at pitches we like.\" Towards the end of the annual meeting, he mentioned that the cash pile will likely reach 200 billion by the end of the second quarter.\r  \nThe Buffett philosophy\r  \nThroughout the meeting, Buffett returned to themes that have defined his career. He urged attendees to pursue careers they love and surround themselves with talented individuals who share their values. His extraordinary partnership with Charlie Munger served as a testament to the power of finding collaborators who both complement and challenge you.\r  \nThis year's meeting marked a turning point for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett faces the monumental task of proving he can shepherd the company into a new era of innovation, changing markets, and a world without his long-time partner. Whether he succeeds remains to be seen.\r  \n\r  \n",

        "post_body": "I was looking at PayPal's 2023 10K today, and the 'deferred income taxes' item in the cash flow statement (page 62) caught my attention. It was -$668M, -$811M, and -$482M for 2023, 2022, and 2021. Which should mean that the IRS views the income reported overstated, and deducted more taxes than shown from the 10K.  \nI found on page 116 that under deferred tax assets, the 'capitalized R&D' item increased by $333M to $1.2B, and \"accruals and allowances\" increased by $313M.\n\nSo if I'm interpreting this right, the company chose to capitalize R&D (costs came to $1.6B in 2023), and understated the actual costs since 2021? If I applied the tax rate of 21%, this came to another ~$1.6B. This is no small amount considering net income is ~$4B. Am I doing this right or mixing something up completely?\n\nAlso, the 2023 10K claims the 'capitalized R&D\" deferred tax asset is $800M for 2022, but it was nowhere to be found in 2022's 10K, nor was it in any previous reports. This item wasn't mentioned anywhere else in the 10K either. Shouldn't such accounting change require an elaboration at least?\n\nIt looks fishy to me, especially after reading the book  \"Quality of Earnings\" which mentions this type of income boosting. Plus, PayPal's management's comm style of trumpeting good news while murmuring bad news has been pretty hard to evoke trust.\n\nNot sure if I'm just being dumb, and reaching out for your help!",

These capitalized r&d costs will be 'delayed' per se, and eventually expensed off as amortisation (over 3 - 7 years as stated by pypl) - hence giving rise to deferred tax assets.\n\nYou are also right that even though paypal may be at liberty to capitalise r&d expenses, it may very well be a means to manage earnings, hence reducing earnings 'quality' as you put it. You may want to look at metrics such as roic, fcf over the past 10 years to investigate earnings quality deeper.\n\nIt does appear that the DTA effects from the  capitalisation of r&d is a recent trend (2022 and 2023 only, 2021 minor) - why this is so in unclear to me without further investigation into the numbers and investigation into qualitative aspects of the business.

At a high level, deferred tax aims to present the timing differences which are created between how tax authorities view incomes and expenses and how accounting standards require the same income and expenditure to be presented.\n\nIn your example, IFRS and other accounting standards allow for entities to capitalise expenditure on research instead of expensing the expenditure. This is because there is a view that the expenditure will result in future economic benefits which are represented by the value of the capitalised asset. The related expense is recognised over the amortisation period of the asset (usually multiple years). The taxation authorities likely view the expenditure as an expense in the year it is incurred.\n\nSo if we consider the difference in timing here, the same transaction is being fully deducted in our tax return in year 1 whereas our accounting profit and loss will be marginally impacted by the same expense over the multiple years which the asset is depreciated. \n\nIn short, the existence of deferred tax is the inevitable consequence of differences between tax law and accounting standards. It is not an indication that the IRS view the income as overstated.",

However, it is very very very unlikely any accounting standard board will introduce new rules that allow more 'aggressive' in reporting - goes against the fundamental principles of accounting. No accounting board will introduce new rules that allows firms to easily inflate earnings artificially without good reason.\n\nFrom the short video you sent - tax code is not accounting code. Changes in tax code will impact how much tax is reported as expense (in your P/L, affecting your net profit) and how much can be deferred. It does not change the rules on whether R&D costs should be capitalised (to the balance sheet & subsequently amortised) or expensed (to the P/L).\n\nAs to how much R&D costs (note costs VS expense) have been capitalised to B/S rather than expensed to P/L:\n\nLooking at pg 44 of the 10K, tech & development expense for 2023 is $2.9b. These are expenses, NOT capitalised. On pg 11, it is mentioned R&D expense for 2023 is $1.6b. These are expenses too, NOT capitalised. Probably safe to assume that this $1.6b is a subset of the $2.9b. All of these are already reflected in P/L.\n\nThe only direct mention of capitalised R&D I can find is on page 71, under property & equipment explaining Paypal's accounting policies. You can see that capitalised software & development costs were $445m and $511m for 2023 and 2022 respectively. These are R&D costs that are not expensed but have been capitalised. These eventually get amortised (over 3 years) and gets reflected under the tech & devleopment expense mentioned in my previous paragraph. This $445m and $551m are also likely under 'purchases of property & equipment' on the cash flow statement.\n\nWhile it is true that net DTA relating to capitalised R&D have risen by \\~$330m, and I do see your logic as to how you derived $1.6b of 'extra' R&D costs that were not expensed, I do think it is abit of a logical leap. If $1.6bn in cash was indeed spent on R&D and capitalised, it will show up somewhere in the balance sheet (and cash flow statement).\n\nBut looking briefly at the 2 places where capitalised R&D costs can show up (Property & equipment pg 84; and Goodwill & intangible assets pg 81; and also checking against their respective net sales/purchases in the cash flow statement), there is no sign of any increases to the significance of $1.6b, beyond the $445m in the abovementioned page 71.\n\nHence my initial hypothesis still stands - don't think there is anything 'shady' going on, the capitalised r&d costs (the same one that you can find on pg 71), has roughly been around $300-500m from my quick check back to 2020, 2017's 10K. As to why then net DTA for capitalised R&D rose \\~$330m I remain unclear but to me is likely either a tax code thing or an accounting presentation thing, neither or which would be 'shady' earnings management.\n\nIn general it is great to dig deep and look at numbers with skepticism. For example, understanding whether an 'excessive' amount of R&D have been capitalised will impact future earnings (when they are subsequently amortised).\n\nBut I think time is better spent evaluating earnings quality based on free cash flow and other return metrics, rather than doubting the truthfulness of the financial reporting. If not we are either looking at something alot more serious than low quality earnings - either 1 company is completely fraudulent in its reporting (not completely impossible, see Enron); or it's doomsday as the accounting standards board and big 4 audit firms are completely useless and no financial statements can be trusted and relied upon.",

I myself am not a super successful swing trader who can give you lots of details. I have my own methods, which typically involves options.\n\nOne example of a simple strategy is to buy after a breakout from a previous resistance point or a new higher high. Then set a stop just below that resistance point which is now below you and provides support. As the stock rises, you could have a trailing stop if a shorter duration moving a average crosses below a longer duration, like if the 9 ema crosses under the 21 ema, or some other similar way of preserving your gains. I recommend carefully looking back at old charts and practicing with very low volumes.\n\nFor free intro sources, take a look at Cranky\\_Crypto who has posted some great (pinned) posts on breakouts. He has a series of several posts.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cranky\\_Crypto/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cranky_Crypto/)\n\n  \nYou could also check out babypips for a longer guide to technicals.\n\n[https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex)\n\n  \nI think technicals are important and helpful when you keep it simple: support, resistance, a couple moving averages.

Everyone has been talking about bundling services and providing more value to customers while increasing revenues, but no one has done it yet. That is, until now. This should push WBD streaming revenue and growth where it previously lacked, and Disney should also see a big boost from this.

        "post_body": "I am considering buying into UTMD. UTMD is a small ($247m) medical device manufacturer that I believe is a good prospect for a long term play, but I'm open to be proven wrong. \n\nTo start, they have strong earnings averaging 30% for the past 10 years. Their ROE is eh at 12.9%, but this is mainly due to their cash pile which I explain below. \n\nTheir main source of revenue is patented devices for women before and after childbirth, as well as neonatal care. I don't know enough about medicine to know how they compare against other similar products, however the fact that they are able to sell their products as a premium shows me that they are highly valued. They also seem to be reasonably internationally diversified, with the US being 41% of their sales.\n\nThey have a high free cash flow and use it mainly to pay a dividend and buy back shares. They have also been hoarding cash for 4 years though I'm not sure why this is. On the plus side, they have built a fortress balance sheet of $106m of current assets compared to $7m total liabilities. Management says this is to weather economic downturn, which is fine if true, but I feel if they have no use use for this cash they should increase they dividend or buybacks. Otherwise, holding the cash is decreasing their ROE. It's also possible they have saving for an acquisition and are not willing to dilute shares or take on debt to fund it. But it's not the worst thing to hold TBills in a high interest rate environment.\n\nTheir revenues haven't grown much, growing only 25% in 10 years. They are likely having trouble selling their products to new customers. Management says this is due to the rise of physician groups focused more on low prices rather than quality, and they have more success when they are able to sell to individual facilities and clinics. Who knows if that's true but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nOne risk: they are currently facing an injury lawsuit for their Filshie Clip system, a device for female birth control. I've tried to read about it as much as I can but haven't found much as to the likelihood of success, the number of plaintiffs, or the expected damage if the company were to lose. Management seems to think it's not an issue and said it would not likely impact their finances this year. Regardless of the outcome, word has gotten around and sales were down 9% last year (the product is 17% of domestic sales).\n\nOverall, I feel that their high profit margin, collection of patents, and strong balance sheet make this an attractive company. The stock is at a 7 year low and may be a good time to get in. Thoughts?\n\n\n",

Let's take an example: You sell a $200 CSP on Tesla that expires on May 30th for $5.00. This means you get paid $500 upfront ($5 x 100 shares). \n\nHowever, there's a catch. If by May 30th Tesla stock ends up below $200, say $150, you will be required to purchase 100 shares of Tesla at $200 (and you keep the $500). On the other hand, if Tesla stock finishes the month at $210, you get to pocket the $500 without having to buy 100 shares of Tesla.",

It isn't terribly efficient to use a CSP in place of a long position, so I will sell ATM or ITM if I'm really trying to get assigned. Alternatively, I'll sell well OTM and pick up nickels. If the stock runs up and away from me, so be it. As a general rule, I don't open a CSP at a strike price I wouldn't be willing to get assigned at. It reduces the need for downside risk protection, since at that point, I'm better off than a different investor who just bought at market prices. Even if the shares black swan to 0, the options seller collected a premium at least. If the underlying investment is volatile or highly speculative, a protective put might be wise.\n\n\nIf I sell a CSP and the shares have an unexpectedly strong rally shortly thereafter, I may roll that position up to harvest profits quickly. If I am sitting on say a 60% potential profit on the trade early on, I'm rarely going to leave the position open in hopes of chasing the remaining 40%.",

        "post_date": "2024-05-08T23:43:41",
        "post_body": "**Business Model:** JBI is primarily a vendor to the self-storage industry. They design and sell a number of proprietary access control hardware. To a lesser extent, they sell to commercial and industrial clients. Self-storage generates steady demand and represents the majority of their business, while commercial and industrial demand for products is more volatile and makes up a smaller revenue mix.\n\nBusiness model complexity: \ud83d\udfe2\n\n**Financial Performance:** 4.6% revenue growth gives us another consistent year of revenue growth. This is a less profound revenue growth year than we see with the sharp fall in 2020 coupled with a sharp rise in 2021 and 2022. Sales to commercial clients declined, but were offset but strong growth in the self-storage client base which is predominantly the business model. 2023 was a very profitable year, with free cash flow accounting for 142% of non-GAAP adjusted net earnings. Leverage trended downward and liquidity is strong.\n\nHealth: \ud83d\udfe2\n\n**Market Position**: JBI has a strong market position with high volume, high margin business in both new and refurb supply to self-storage companies as well as commercial and industrial clients like hospitals, schools, manufacturers, etc. The access control and automation products they sell are proprietary and their competitors lack the efficiency and market-share JBI management are bringing together today.\n\n**Risk:** Janus is a building supply company, and faces risks with raw materials inputs, which can be volatile. The most notable raw material risk is with steel, which has both unfavorable price fluctuations and a complex supply chain. The consistent nature of demand from their self-storage vendor relationships does have an offsetting effect, and their market share and efficiency give them breathing room.\n\nAdvantage & Risk: \ud83d\udfe1\n\nGrowth: Continued efforts to expand market-share in self-storage niche is expected to drive consistent growth in the 4-6% range. There is upside risk to their innovations at their new manufacturing site in Poland and the innovations within their software center in Georgia. Guidance on performance towards these strategic moves looks modest, and improvements to cost and revenue beyond the 2023 guidance may lead the shares to outperform the market. Downside risk looks de minimus, but as with any pivot in strategy, the possibility of cost overruns or lack of results also exists. In any case, growth guidance given continued efficiency and innovation looks conservative, and upside risk looks to outweigh downside risk.\n\nGrowth: \ud83d\udfe2\n\n**Valuation:** Right now, the P/E ratio is sitting at 14.57 on a TTM basis. This is below industry averages and represents an impressively subdued value proposition given JBIs outperformance of the QQQ over the last 12 months. Damodoran guides growth within this industry around 14%, and while I don't see a catalyst for JBI to drastically outperform that number, I do not see a reason for them to drastically underperform either (despite conservative management guidance and analyst sentiment). Even if growth hugs that upper asymptote of 6% for full year 2024, this company is reducing debt, growing earnings and becoming more efficient all the time. Earnings expansion should lead to several turns upward despite the hesitancy we have seen towards small caps by larger market players in recent years.\n\nValuation: \ud83d\udfe2\n\n**Why might investors want to buy this now, or grow their existing positions?** Stock buyback plan is in swing and will increase shareholder value proposition. This, accompanied with very strong fundamentals indicates investors can earn a decent ROI here with less risk than the broader S&P. Lastly, insiders do own nearly 10% of the company's issued shares, meaning they have skin in the game and this can be a strong catalyst for good stewardship in isolation.",

What I don't understand is how the growth rate in building them can be so high. \n\nIt seems like a high growth rate in building them is going to lead to a glut, and then nothing being built for a while.

Suburban areas tend to be well served (if not over-served) by this, but urban and rural customers often are undeserved or not served yet by this. So, while I think you're asking about the plateau, and when we get there, right now I think we're still seeing new types of customers get access.\n\nAdditionally, there is new demand being created as people are priced out of houses and rentals. Urbanism, better build quality and looser lending have led people to acquire a lifetime of things they can no longer fit into the houses in their price range.\n\nIn short, there is an asymptote. We are a long ways off from seeing it in my opinion.\n\n2. JBI's significant interest is in selling the locks, doors and technology that these companies rely on. Mainly access control technology and hardware. Meaning that if new construction slows, in the future, they continue to benefit from retrofits, rebuilds due to fires and damage and generally maintaining the millions of these units nationwide. So while the real estate side of self-storage is on the periphery of my circle of expertise - the economics of supplying a huge sub-industry like this is right in the center. This is a niche market and they essentially occupy the entire field.",

        "post_body": "I recently heard that a good metric to consider when buying stocks is a companies equity to debt ratio.  \nI get that, it makes sense, if they don't have the equity to cover their debts then you'd imagine that's not a good sign. But as I'm making a list of possible stocks I've come across a couple of things that on the surface look bad but I'm thinking that might not be the case so thought I'd ask\n\nFor example, many financial holdings have a ratio of or close to 1.0, (LSE:LGEN). As they are financial service providers a 1 for 1 seems like it might be ok?\n\nOthers have really low ratios but in the retail sector, such as Tesco (LSE:TSCO) with a 0.66. Is that really that bad? Or is there some reason and to be expected in retail? Or maybe in a services based sector like Telecoms or cellphone service providers\n\nTIA",

However, the company expects weaker results for this business segment for the current quarter, which has caused the stock to fall 10% in trading.\n\n# Background\n\nA key priority for the entertainment giant was to achieve sustained profitability in streaming.

Still, investors were unhappy with the Disney+ Hotstar news, plunging the stock down.\n\n# Other metrics\u00a0\n\nDisney beat its Q2 adjusted earnings of $1.21 a share compared to analyst predictions of $1.10. This is much higher than the $0.93 reported by Disney during Q2 of 2023. Revenue came out to be $22.1 billion, which met expectations and is a slight increase above the $21.82 billion the company reported in the year-ago period.\u00a0\n\nDisney also surprisingly raised its guidance for its full-year adjusted earnings growth to 25%, which is up from the prior 20%.\n\nI wanna hear the ValueInvesting SubReddit's opinion on Disney's earnings.

These factors include:Noncomparable or Timing-Related Items Impacting Q3 Results: The company highlighted several noncomparable or timing-related items expected to adversely impact the third quarter's results. These include the timing of media and tech expenses, noncomparable items in the prior year at consumer products, and the timing of Easter.Increased Expenses: Disney is facing higher wage expenses and preopening expenses related to new ventures such as the Disney Treasure and Adventure Cruise ships as well as Disney Cruise Line's New Island lookout key. Additionally, there is some normalization of post-COVID demand which may be affecting financial projections.Entertainment Segment Concerns: Despite achieving profitability in its streaming business for the quarter, Disney anticipates a loss for its entertainment direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment in Q3, primarily due to Disney+ Hotstar ICC Cricket rights. Core subscriber growth at Disney+ is not expected in Q3, although it is anticipated to return in Q4.Cost Inflation at Parks: At Disneyland, despite growing attendance and per capita spend, results declined year-over-year due to cost inflation including from higher labor expenses.Uncertainty Around Direct-to-Consumer Profitability: There are uncertainties regarding direct-to-consumer profitability, subscriber levels, and average revenue per user (ARPU), based on assumptions around future content slate strength, churn expectations, pricing decisions, bundling strategies, technological advances, macroeconomic conditions, and efforts to rationalize costs while preserving revenue.These concerns overshadowed positive aspects such as strong international parks growth driven by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and domestic growth contributions from Walt Disney World and the Cruise business. Additionally, while the entertainment segment saw a significant increase in operating income driven by direct-to-consumer revenue growth year-over-year and generated operating income exceeding guidance primarily due to expense savings, these positive results were not enough to alleviate investor concerns over the challenges outlined above.",

Same goes for beer companies, coffee companies, retail etc. I dont want politicians going after businesses due to their positions. Not helping them is fine, but going after them?!? \n\nAlso Disney has been pro lgbt for an incredibly long time. The Florida governor going after them after that has been the case for decades is an attempt by him to get a mob to follow him. It isn't about helping the mob have better lives. It definitely isn't about helping Disney be a better company. Its about him desire for power that he thinks the mob will give him. We need better leaders than that who are actually willing to put that kind of time and effort into making our lives materially better.

As the name suggests they are crude oil refiner and produce diesel, gasoline, naptha etc. for the Israeli and international market.  Anybody familiar with this or has any background on this name?  Its a penny stock so looks high risk but numbers are intriguing.  What is your take?\n\n",

Crox is such a high ROI cash-making monster that they will pay off Hey Dudes purchase debt and be completely fine. It doesn\u2019t say good things about the capabilities of the management tho. I am willing to look past it tho as one bad-ish decision during a very solid few years of management. Crocs is the value play of this century. Its the Coca Cola of our generation.

I understand why it happened and I think the CEO\u2019s actions were pretty stupid of him but a company with fundamentals like ULTA should not be hammered like this. This company has no debt, consistent revenue, consistent FCF and a Return On Capital Employed of 41.44% which is incredible. ULTA has also been doing consistent buybacks for almost a decade. Like I said before the CEO\u2019s comments were very stupid especially just 3 weeks after a solid earnings call but none of what he was concerned about has shown in competitors earnings so far and none of his concerns apply specifically to ULTA. Overall I think this is a fantastic compounding business that has been beaten down simply out of irrational fear.\n\nNext we have TJX, I decided to talk about both these companies in one post because they have so many similarities. I do feel that TJX is relatively cheap right now (but not nearly as cheap as ULTA). Similarly this company has no debt, paying off the last of it in 2023. Their revenue is incredibly consistent too, same situation with the FCF. TJX has a Return On Capital Employed of 30.05% which is fantastic. They have also been consistently paying and growing their dividend since 2000 as well as simultaneously initiating consistent buybacks. With both companies Capital Expenditures relatively low the path for future growth is layed out.\n\nI\u2019d like to conclude with saying that I invite any discussion but I feel that both companies are resilient compounding machines that can expect market beating growth in the future.",

This led to the stock price to become disconnected from its underlying business performance.\n\nHowever, Palantir has a strong focus on data analytics and AI, serving government agencies and enterprises. It has been growing its commercial business and introducing new AI-powered products that are resonating with customers. Yesterday\u2019s earnings was a clear example of the current growth displayed by Palantir.\n\nWhat are your overall thoughts on this stock, and where it\u2019s positioned currently.",

What are the risks associated with Palantir Technologies Inc. as discussed in the Earnings call Q1 2024?The risks associated with Palantir Technologies Inc., as discussed in their Q1 2024 earnings call, include:Geopolitical Stance and Public Perception: Palantir's outspoken stance on geopolitics and its defense of Western values could potentially alienate certain stakeholders or markets. The company's vocal criticism of what it describes as a \"regressive way of thinking\" and \"woke\" ideologies poses a risk to its public image and could impact its relationships with clients or partners who hold differing views.Dependence on Government Contracts: A significant portion of Palantir's business comes from government contracts, such as the over $178 million contract awarded by the U.S. Army under the TITAN program. While this demonstrates the company's strength in securing large government deals, it also highlights a dependency that could be risky if political winds shift or if there are significant changes in government spending priorities.Market Competition and Misunderstanding: Despite CEO Alexander Karp's assertion that Palantir has no real competition due to its unique software infrastructure, the perception of competition or misunderstanding of Palantir's offerings could slow down its growth. The company faces challenges in educating potential clients about the distinct advantages of its products over competitors', which could delay sales cycles.European Market Challenges: Palantir acknowledges headwinds in Europe, where it generates 16% of its business. With Europe heading towards minimal GDP growth, Palantir faces challenges in this market that may not have easy remedies. This situation underscores the importance of geographic diversification for reducing risk.Execution Risks: Karp mentioned that while they are making progress, they are not flawlessly executing on their sales motion. This indicates potential internal challenges related to scaling up their operations and effectively selling their platform, especially as they aim to educate potential clients on the value proposition of their anti-terror platform and other offerings.These risks highlight the importance for investors to consider both external market conditions and internal execution capabilities when evaluating Palantir's future performance.",

Value investors actively ferret out stocks they think the\u00a0stock market\u00a0is underestimating. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term\u00a0fundamentals. The overreaction offers an opportunity to profit by purchaing stocks at discounted prices.\"\n\nNowhere, in this entire passage, does it say anything about the stock must have low P/E, P/S, P/FCF etc. It says less than their book value but that on its own does not imply a stock is undervalued either.\n\nThe only thing it does say, however, is exactly what I stated before, buying stocks that appear to be trading below their intrinsic value.\n\nIf I offer you to buy all of Palantir for $1, is that not value investing? By your definition, it isn't. In this case, if Palantir was trading for a valuation of $1 you wouldn't buy it?\n\nYet I think any person alive would take the offer? Why? Because its undervalued, i.e. part of value investing.\n\nSo I think it is you who doesn't understand value investing, and thinks that a stock must be trading at under 15 P/E otherwise its not value, even if it has revenue growth of 1000% per year for the next 100 years.\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

        "post_body": "Back in 1976, Buffett recognized GEICO as a standout business, far superior to other insurance companies he owned. As GEICO's stock price climbed, it grew to represent 35% of his stock portfolio and 55% of Berkshire Hathaway's book value. Faced with overconcentration, Buffett sold his shares back to GEICO in a tender offer. This move had significant tax advantages as it maintained his ownership percentage and the sales could be treated as dividends, which were taxed more favorably at the time.\n\n\n\nFast forward to today, and we see Apple playing a similarly dominant role in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio. Apple is undeniably a top-tier company with massive cash reserves, primarily returning value to shareholders through buybacks. Like with GEICO, Buffett finds himself in a position where selling shares back to Apple makes strategic sense, especially when he can get 5% in cash, compared to 3% earnings yield of Apple.\n\n\n\nI've discussed this in more detail in my latest video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcLDN0l6xc0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcLDN0l6xc0)\n\n",

As usual someone asked Buffett, if he were managing a smaller amount of money, is it true he could earn 50% annual returns and how specifically would he go about it.\n\nBuffett proceeded to explain a particular investment he either made or looked at, that would reflect his approach, if managing smaller amounts of money.\n\nThe investment in question was a company called, Green Bay & Western Railroad Company. He noted that it had debentures that were actually common stock, and common stock that were actually debentures.\n\nSo I went investigating to see just what the hell he meant, and found the court transcripts / judgements that related to the company and explained the investment. Here's an overview of the investment.\n\n**History of the Railroad:**\n\nThe \"GBW\" railroad was some 254 miles in length and historically never made much / any money. The result of this is it had to be recapitalized at one point in its existence. The earliest balance sheet I could find for the company looked liked this:\n\nConstruction Assets: $9,954,000\n\nEquipment Assets: $123,359\n\nMaterials & Supplies: $22,640\n\nTotal Assets: $10.1m\n\nFinanced by:\n\nCapital stock: 25,000 shares, par value $100, $2,500,000\n\nClass \"A\" Debentures, 600, par value $1000, $600,000\n\nClass \"B\" Debentures, 7,000, par value $1,000, $7,000,000\n\nThe railroad was organized such that any distributable profits, would first be paid out in the following manner:\n\n2.5% on the value of capital stock, 2.5% on the balance of the Class A debentures. If any profits remained after these charges were paid, further pro rata payments were to be made to both the capital stock and class A debentures holders up to 5% of their invested values.\n\nAfter and only after such payments were made, if any residual profits were left over, and if management decided they wanted to, payments could be made to the Class B debenture holders.\n\nSo the Class B debentures holders, really had no power whatsoever into the say of either how the railroad should be managed, or how profits should / could be distributed, despite being the majority financers of the railroad.\n\nHowever, because the capital stock and class A debentures had the right to fixed income payouts, the argument was made by the class B debenture holders, that they represented in effect debt like instruments, whilst the class B debentures, being entitled to whatever was leftover, more closely resembled equity, hence Buffett's observation.\n\n**Issue at Hand:**\n\nThe railroad, was eventually acquired by a company called Itel Corporation and merged its management with another railroad owned by Itel, the Fox River Valley Railroad corp. This corporate action in and of itself didn't cause the issue.\n\nHowever, much later, Itel in turn sold both railroads to the Wisconsin Central Corp, for a combined price of some $61m.\n\nThe issue that came to light, was in the wording of the debenture contract held by the Class B debenture holders. They claimed that the wording of their debenture contract stated, that the Class B debenture holders would receive any residual consideration, after all other charges over the company were settled, i.e. after the capital stock holders and class A debenture holders were paid back.\n\nOn that basis, they felt the Class B debentures were entitled to a sum vastly greater than their $7m at par value, considering the sale price. They argued as much as $40m of the value was  attributable to the GBW railroad.\n\nItel corp, naturally had the opposing view that no such right existed, that the wording very clearly stated, they would only receive back, in the event of a sale, up to $1,000 per debenture, after all other claimants were first paid back.\n\n**Investment Opportunity:**\n\nAt the time of the case, it's stated in one of the transcripts that the Class B debentures had a market value around $120. So the investment opportunity appeared to be two fold, either a) the class B debenture holders would be remunerated up to their full $1,000 and or b) they would receive the $1,000 and anything beyond this if the sale price was higher than the $10.1m, required to settle all original claims.\n\nBuffett never mentioned what year he was looking at the company and this investment situation, but the court cases go right up to the early 1990s, so he may have invested in this for his personal account.\n\nUltimately, and interestingly, the Wall Street Journal which covered the sale of the railroad, specified that the Wisconsin Central paid $8.1m for the net assets of the GBW and $52.8m for the Fox River Valley Railroad \"*Wisconsin Central Railroad Corporation, Railroad company to pay Itel $61.2m for assets*\", Jan 9 1992.\n\nSo we can work out the eventual pay out to the claimants and see what the Class B debentures holders may have ultimately been paid from the $8.1m:\n\nCapital Stock holders: $2,500,000\n\nClass A Debentures: $600,000\n\nTotal: $3,100,000\n\nClass B Debentures: $5,000,000 Left over to satisfy their $7,000,000 claim (7,000 debentures)\n\n$714 dollars per Class B debenture compared to market value as stated in the court case of $120.\n\nThe courts ultimately decided that the Class B debentures were only entitled up to their original $1,000, which they appeared to have received the majority of following the sale.\n\n**Thoughts on Investment:**\n\nI think its very interesting when people ask Buffett how would he invest money with smaller sums of money and this is the kind of example he gives. Its so far removed from the \"good company, fair price\" mantra that gets a bit parroted about, money is money at the end of the day, and his ability to see value in situations such as this, which is essentially an analysis of contract risk, I just found very interesting and worth sharing.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nHighly recommend reading the court transcripts as they give a flavour of the arguments from both sides:\n\n[https://casetext.com/case/green-bay-western-rr-co-v-commr-of-internal-revenue](https://casetext.com/case/green-bay-western-rr-co-v-commr-of-internal-revenue)\n\n[https://casetext.com/case/eliasen-v-itel-corp](https://casetext.com/case/eliasen-v-itel-corp)\n\n[https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/082/82.F3d.731.95-3458.html](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/082/82.F3d.731.95-3458.html)",

Someone reached out to me and asked how I researched / found the story, so figures some of you might care to know so you can go look for things yourself.\n\n**Historic Newspaper filings**: If the topic being researched is say pre 1990's or internet search engine indexing, usually the best place to start are historic newspaper filings. There are a variety of ways to get access to them, I use Proquest a lot. If you are in university, school, college you usually will have a subscription available for free.\n\nAll corporate stories prior to the internet were filed via newspapers, so starting there is a great place to get the ball rolling.\n\n**Google Advance Search / \"Hacking\"**: I cannot recommend this enough but teach yourself how to use advance google searching, sometimes called \"hacking\" or \"dorking\". Google indexes all kinds of information that isn't supposed to be in the public domain, but ends up there if parties use the internet to transfer information between themselves.\n\nTo start the search process for this story, I typed in: \"Green Bay & Western Railroad Company\" \"class b\" \"debenture\"\n\nIf you copy and paste that into Google, the first three results are all the case texts I used and sourced for the story. Phrasing your search using the quotation marks in your google search, specifies to Google to only return results with those exact phrases, resulting in much more targeted answers.\n\nFunnily enough my Reddit post, now is top of the results pile for that search, but just underneath it are the cases. \n\nBoth sources I've found are great for researching companies, past and present.",

To complete, they started offering the best warranties in the industry and honoring them. In the last 10 years, build quality and general engineering is now on par with the more common Japanese brands. \n\n\nHowever, the reputation of Honda or Toyota cars being higher quality regardless is perpetuated without evidence. Accordingly, this pushes the price of those brand's vehicles higher and starts to chip away at Hyundai's sales. That price difference may have had some justification back in the Kia Rio days. Recently, a Hyundai Ioniq was a hybrid that beat the Toyota Prius in fuel economy, warranty coverage, and has proven reasonably durable even by the very high modern standards. The kicker is that the Ioniq was easily 4-5k less new, with a much bigger price difference if you start adding even more optional equipment. \n\n\nOne the market of perspective purchasers realize the value and limited risk of Hyundai/Kia, I think it is positioned to capture a segment of newer buyers looking for low entry prices and affordable, low stress transportation. There's also a group that will have purchased recently and may be looking to downsize. Regardless, these factors make Hyundai a very different story than Suzuki. It's an under appreciated juggernaut of a company that is finally refining their cars to be highly competitive with their competition, but they are doing it for several thousands less across virtually every market segment Hyundai sells in. \n\n\nScrew it; I invested in it before during some flat years, then sold to pursue other companies.

They are able to make massive profits right now because they are manufacturing in Korea at a low cost and selling in the US which gives them huge profit margins. If the currency swap flips they are going to be losing profit margins just solely based on currency. Right now a large part of their profits is the North America market. In Korea their largest sales segment is recreational vehicles - yeah, RV's - (yep, to piggy back on the last comment, because their biggest market in S. Korea are retirees). \n\nMy recommendation is to stay away from any of the Chaebol stocks. Trying to understand their ownership and management structure is insanely hard. I also think the Korean Chaebol model of investing in everything is great for everyone but shareholders. If you compare the stock of Samsung vs. Apple - Samsung's stock has done well but not near what Apple's performance. Chaebol grow by taking profits from one line of business and moving into other businesses. I think as an investor you are better off with a company that's focused on long term growth in their sector. \n\nCheck out their RV's - they are kinda of cool.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM6s0HhaxT8&t=480s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM6s0HhaxT8&t=480s)",

        "post_date": "2024-05-07T05:45:48",
        "post_body": "\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-posts-surprise-profit-streaming-103142399.html\n\nBy Lisa Richwine\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney's streaming entertainment unit posted its first profit on Tuesday, two quarters ahead of schedule, and the media company raised its annual earnings per share outlook as it said turnaround efforts were yielding results.\n\nShares of the company were down 1.4% in premarket trading.\n\nDisney now expects adjusted earnings per share to rise by 25% this fiscal year, the company said, up from the 20% it previously forecast. It attributed the change to strong results at theme parks and improvements in the streaming business.\n\nThe direct-to-consumer entertainment division - which includes the Disney+ and Hulu streaming services - reported operating income of $47 million from January through March.\n\nDisney had promised Wall Street that the streaming operation would become profitable by September. The division had been losing money since Disney+ debuted in 2019 in the company's major push to compete with Netflix.\n\n\"Our strong performance this past quarter demonstrates we have turned the corner and entered a new era for our company,\" Chief Executive Bob Iger, who defeated board challenges from activist investors last month, said in a statement.\n\n\"The steps we are taking today lend themselves to solidifying Disney's place as the preeminent creator of global content,\" Iger added.\n\nLike other media companies, Disney has been trying to adapt to consumer migration from cable television to streaming entertainment.\n\nIger, who came out of retirement to revamp Disney in November 2022, instituted cost cuts that are expected to reach at least $7.5 billion by the end of September. He also unveiled a 10-year, $60 billion investment in theme parks and announced plans for a stand-alone ESPN streaming app, among other efforts.\n\nThe earlier-than-expected profit from streaming entertainment was driven by aggressive cost management, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said in an interview. A year ago, the streaming unit lost $587 million.\n\nDisney+ added more than 6 million customers during the quarter, and average revenue per user rose 44 cents, outside of India. Disney offers a lower-priced plan in India that it counts separately.\n\nBecause of costs to stream cricket, streaming entertainment will likely report a loss for the current quarter but swing back to a profit the following period, Johnston said.\n\nDisney also reports results for a combined streaming unit, including ESPN+. The combined unit should generate a fiscal fourth-quarter profit and become a \"meaningful future growth driver for the company, with further improvements in profitability for fiscal 2025,\" Disney said in its earnings statement.\n\nFor January through March, the combined streaming business with ESPN+ lost $18 million.\n\nDuring that time, the Mouse House posted diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, of $1.21, ahead of analysts' consensus estimate of $1.10, according to LSEG data. Quarterly revenue rose to $22.1 billion, in line with analyst forecasts.\n\nThe company's experiences division, which includes the Disney theme parks around the world, reported operating income of $2.3 billion, a 12% increase from a year earlier.\n\nAt Disney's entertainment segment, the home of the traditional TV business, streaming and film, operating income rose 72% from a year earlier to $781 million.\n\nThe sports unit that includes ESPN saw operating income decline by 2% to $778 million, which it attributed to the timing of college football playoff games.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Henderson, Matthew Lewis and Christopher Cushing)\n",

I have a few questions if you don't mind me asking.\n\n\n// 1) I see your portfolio is quite diversified, given your top holding is only 16% and you have over 15 stocks. Why don't you concentrate more on your most confident holdings? Coz even Warren Buffetts is 50% into his largest holdings (i.e. Apple) Won't you also diversify your winnings if you didn't invest in a higher concentration for a stock that you think is deeply undervalued?\n\n\n// 2) Do you have any personal goals when running this portfolio and researching for undervalued stocks? Just for fun, for retirement, or for a personal milestone, etc...\n\n\n// 3) I also invested in Google, Meta, TSMC and Alibaba when they are at their dip. How long do you plan to hold these stocks now that the US stock market is at all-time high? I know many value investors will say \"forever\", but yeah they rose 100% up from their dip 1 year ago.\n\n\n// 4) Do you have any undervalued stocks that you are planning to invest in the future / just invested recently?

When I was in university we had someone who was a portfolio manager for UBS explain to us his top down / bottom up approach and that captivated me. A lesson I never forgot and applied to my portfolio when I wanted to diversify outside of just vfv & bank. \n\nI aim to have international exposure and diversity within industries as well. I try to only pick companies I'm either truly knowledgeable about or can understand the business model / product. Hence why you will not see any Crypto / healthcare / biotech / etc. It's all way out of my realm. I purposely left out gold / precious metal which may have been a mistake but I didn't feel confident enough to buy anything else than a physical gold etf or receipt (like Canadian Mint). \n\nI stick to very strict valuation metric and will often run 3 different formulas, use a series of website to see if I'm somewhere close to other valuations. \n\nFrom there it's a mix of macroeconomic thesis / industry leaders / some underappreciated companies / turnaround / Thesis on specific industries / Risk management / etc. \n\nI'll always keep up with the market / geopolitics / world economies to have set plans. If X happens I will do Y sort of things. It keeps me discipline and unemotional to market turmoil. At the very least I will always have a last resort watchlist of companies I would feel confident buying even if the world was near it's end lol. For the most part I'm not too worried about economics since it's such a complex science even PHD economics often can't agree with each other, but I like to keep up with certain key data. \n\nI also read a ton. I've read the intelligent investor a few times, warren buffet, charlie munger, peter lynch, seth klarman, Louis Engel, etc. I try to read daily and see if I can learn something new. \n\nThough I am a graduate I decided recently to find courses online on behavioral finance. I think that's something not enough investors put effort in learning. It annoyed me that I only ever had a handful of mentions on this topic throughout my studies. \n\nThere's more to it but I think those big key points are the core of it, I truly treat this like it's a business. So far I reinvest everything made but perhaps in a few decades I'll start collecting some profits for myself or if I ever have to tone it down.",

It's up to the management team but if they play it right they can really 10x this thing and it wouldn't be that hard to grow. Monetizing when they go oversea can be a challenge but I think they can definitely get big stars to sellout arenas wherever they go. WWE also has potential internationally, they've proved it recently in their European tour so despite my decent gains I remain bullish and haven't sold. \n\nI believe their Q1 comes out tomorrow so I'm curious to see, but I think so far from what I've valued with some quick napkin math their Q1 and Q2 should prove decent this year.

                "comment_body": "Hey thanks a lot for the compliment it's appreciated. To answer your questions; \n\n  \n1) Maybe it's paranoia, but I generally try to remain as diversified as I can within reason. I find things to be so unpredictable and often there's huge butterfly effect affecting certain industries that will change them forever that I couldn't see myself going all-in on a specific stock. If you had asked me in 2018 I would've told you that canadian banks & low asset requirement tech companies were the best. But the business landscape changes at unparalleled levels. Perhaps it's a mix of innovation, geopolitics or the generic business landscape. Believe it or not but my favorite company for a long time were apple / mastercard / walmart and althoug they have been insanely good to me I still don't add to those positions anymore. Though hindsight being 20/20 if I had seen costco in 2018 I probably would've made it a staple. To this day it's the only company I regret not buying into. For one reason or another I had invested in walmart instead and althoug it's been great I would've done much better with costco. \n\n2) My goal was to be financially independent by 30, mostly driven by how much I hated my jobs in my early 20's. I had graduated with a GED and had 2 jobs that were quite physical. I was trying to get into real estate so I lived frugally and basically worked all the time. I eventually joined a small business as an investor and fell in love with it. Meeting 2 laid-back guys who didn't seem to be under as much stress as I was I knew right away I wanted something to do with business. So I decided to go back to school and was lovestruck on investing, where as before I only put money aside into a bank and vfv since that was one tip an uncle had given me long ago. To this day I read nothing but books / pursue further education only towards investment. It's been the thing that changed my life for the better and at the same time became my life. I once heard peter lynch mention he looks at stocks every day and still actively invests. The man could've retired 30 years ago and purely invest for the love of it. That inspires me tremendously. \n\n3) when it comes to Google, Meta & TSM I am up more than 100% on those positions (Specially Meta) and I plan on holding them for the foreseeable future, though I did trim all 3 of those positions. Alibaba is a stock I bought into at 71/average so the returns are barely there. It's 1% of my portfolio and I believe it can have the potential to 100x if certain favorable wind comes into their wings. But 'm very patient so I don't plan on ever selling. \n\n4) My last positions I started building were into car parts / car repair companies. From a personal anecdote the interest rates and fees that dealership takes are way too much. I needed a new vehicle and had to buy it outright because there was no way I was paying an extra 10,000$ for no good reason. And once talking to various people I realized everyone around me was mostly fixing their cars or paying for repairs as opposed to trading them in. Maybe I'm wrong and somehow the economy picks up enough to justify the interest payments & motivate people to spend those amounts again. But I am not seeing it for now. I can also say at the moment a company I've been bullish on has been Mastercard for the past few years for a similar thesis and that's always a company I keep a close eye on if any buying opportunity arises but again, I'm sure there will eventually be a dark cloud even over Mastercard that I haven't foreseen.",

I'm comfortable leaving Mastercard and apple as the only 2 remaining holdings. I did sell starbucks, coca cola & visa recently leaving me with the 43% cash position that I'll most likely keep that way for the remainder of the year.\n\nThey were 3 companies I was up a lot on and I didn't see the growth in, might be a bit of a contrarian play but I still believe apple can find a way to keep growing so I haven't trimmed that position at all.

Consequently, most analysts fear being excluded from crucial discussions if they forecast earnings or ratings below the Wall Street average.\u00a0Also, analysts face heavier scrutiny when their pessimistic forecasts fail to align with a stock\u2019s success, unlike instances where positive predictions don\u2019t translate into performance. It\u2019s easier to criticize failures than successes. This fear of being wrong, coupled with the risk of damaging relationships with management, deters analysts from taking bold stances.

        "post_body": "In light of abnormally high valuations, it's crucial to consider the most effective use of cash. Should we invest in treasury bills, or would stock buybacks be more advantageous? Alternatively, is distributing dividends or engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) preferable? There is also the option of organic investment. It is generally understood that higher interest rates offer the potential for greater returns compared to periods of abnormally low rates. However, it's also acknowledged that the risk of losses increases if the economic conditions deteriorate. \n\nGiven these considerations, which strategy do you believe is most prudent at this time, and why?\n\n1. **Investing in Treasury Bills**: This is a low-risk option that might be appealing if the goal is to preserve capital in an uncertain market. Treasury bills typically offer a safe return, especially when interest rates are high.\n2. **Stock Buybacks**: This can be an effective way to return value to shareholders, especially if the company\u2019s stock is undervalued. Buybacks also signal confidence in the company\u2019s future prospects.\n3. **Distributing Dividends**: Regular dividends can attract and retain investors looking for steady income, which can be particularly appealing during volatile market conditions.\n4. **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)**: This approach can offer strategic advantages such as market expansion and diversification. However, M&A comes with high risks, especially in a high-valuation environment, as it can lead to overpaying.\n5. **Organic Investment**: Investing in the company\u2019s own growth through research and development or expanding operations can yield high returns. However, it requires a solid market position and a favorable business environment to mitigate risks.\n\nWhere do we stand today? For companies that secured financing at unusually low interest rates prior to 2020-2021, the sustainability of their business models comes into question as their debt matures and refinancing becomes necessary. What will be the impact on their profit margins when they need to borrow at rates exceeding 5%? What strategies should these companies implement now to best prepare for this upcoming financial challenge?",

Look at Amazon for example, instead of doing share buybacks or dividends, management announced they first want to tackle their debts. Which in my opinion is the most urgent matter, garantee long-term health of the business, before creating short-term shareholder value.\n\nI would be very wary of M&A's, increasing legal scrutiny and the foregone days of cheap credit have serious implications on M&A's. Therefore, I would (if I were the CEO) currently abstain from these deals, unless the value of your business seriously increased due to this.\n\nOrganic investments are very risky, for example, Meta has tried this with the 'Metaverse' and as of right now they burned an approximately 45 billion USD on it, while the project returned a meagre 440 million in revenue last quarter. Additionally, many companies quite frankly cannot organically grow by simply throwing money at something (e.g. Google would not grow by throwing 10 billion at Google Search).\n\nTreasury bills are definitely very interesting for many companies (hence many companies with a large cash pile already invest in treasury bills). They offer a secure way of keeping the money up with inflation (plus a little extra), moreover they can be easily sold whenever another opportunity arrives.\n\n  \nAll in all, the use of cash depends a lot on the underlying business.

By today's market open, the prices have increased a bit, ranging from 0% to 10% increase from their lows. \n\nToday, I'm sharing with you guys a list I collected from my research, these are companies that have just reached their 5-year or 10-year lows:\n\n1. Pfizer\n2. Bristol-Myer Squibb\n3. CVS Health\n4. British American Tobacco\n5. Takeda Pharmaceuticals\n6. BCE\n7. Brown-Forman\n8. SBA Communications\n9. Vodafone Group\n10. Zoom Video Communications\n11. Warner Bros Discovery\n12. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n13. Yum China Holdings\n14. Incyte\n15. Sirius XM Holdings\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) seems like a great opportunity, knowing Buffett added a significant stake this recent quarter (if I'm not mistaken). \n\nDo you guys feel there's a value opportunity within this list?

WBD - an interesting beast. they have so many problems, its crazy. still, I believe it WBD is one of the best remaining storytellers out there. the expectations are very low, so if they just continue generating cash and paying debt, 20% annually is feasible. end game for me is a buyout.

And added some more today. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, there\u2019s only one of each. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m a rich snob.  But as a boss I\u2019m constantly throw Starbucks gift cards and receiving them.   Teacher appreciation week here in America.  Starbucks gift cards being given daily. \n\n\nI\u2019m an AP at Disney world.  My kids are young. We stay on property, we buy the ears, wait in line for princess pics, and swap pins with CMs. I get upset when people talk trash about the classics and even the new one WISH is great for what it is. My daughter has all the princess dresses and dolls. We have a Mickey plane, Mickey bike, Mickey towels, pillows, welcome mats and everything else you could imagine. \n\n\nRewind the tape 5 years back. I hadn\u2019t been to Disney in 10+ years let alone own anything Disney.  Throw in a couple kids to my mix.  It\u2019s taken over the house. \n\nAs long as there are children, Disney is going to the moon.  Screw your calls, screw your puts, Disney has all parents by the balls.  Because no amount of money is worth smiles and happiness and Disney smiles are the biggest. \n\n\nIf a recession were to hit, Americans will be clinging to their guns, religion, and the one thing that reminded them of better times when they had money - Starbucks coffee.  \n\nStarbucks and Disney to the moon, boys.

In their core business --the reimbursements for pharmacies keeps getting squeezed. \n* Highly levered balance sheet\n* No moat. The competition isn't just CVS. In the physical retail space it's every large chain that also has a pharmacy so Walmart, Kroger, Publix, Wegmans, etc. It's also easy for pharmacists to open a pharmacy -- there are several independent ones that opened in my sister's neighborhood over that past years. On top of all that, you have \"disruptors\" like Amazon Pharmacy that can stomach losses to gain marketshare. \n* Worker satisfaction in the drain. Go ask a pharmacist and see how they feel about places like WBA or CVS. Many are leaving to work at places like labs, in-patient positions, hospitals, or even starting their own pharmacy. \n* Largest shareholder (Stefano Pessina) is chairman of the board and his wife is also serves on the board.

Yes, nike has a moat, but the likelihood of other companies taking some of its market share is difficult to ascertain especially when you see the company\u2019s growth is in decline. The second issue is the company hasn\u2019t been growing consistently as it has. The question is whether it will return to having a favorable growth margin. Again, the answer to this question is unclear. Third is whether the current stock price is undervalued. The stock price is down because the Chinese market is down and their revenue/growth prospects have been negatively impacted. These factors may continue to impact the company, and this presents a decent argument for why the company may be fairly valued atm, and other investments in the market are more attractive. Nike is not going anywhere, and will continue to be a huge player in its field imo. But i\u2019m not sure its a good investment considering where they are at the moment.",

They were a company that was focused on athletics and created products that were designed for athletes. I think this is what drove them to create high quality and cutting edge products. They were constantly innovating around this idea and that was what made Nike great. Phil Knight goes into great detail on this concept in Shoe Dog. \n\nFollowing the pandemic they made a huge push to almost exclusively sell online/direct to consumer and started cutting ties with retailers. They\u2019ve since started to walk this back because it was a huge mistake and has cost the company. I think the debacle with their new MLB uniforms is microcosm of where the company is right now. I think they\u2019ve lost their identity as a company and what they were founded on. The company was literally founded to create a better running shoe than what was available, and today no serious runner wears Nike. \n\nThey\u2019re still a household name and one of the most recognizable brands in the world, but I see a need for some major changes within the company\n\nSide note, there was a great WSJ article on Nike from a few weeks ago.

If there were massive gains already then what they knew was going to happen probably already happened. It'd shine a light on just how \"lucky\"  their trading is.\n\nAlso the changes since the disclosure date might be useful in seeing if a politician is making trades that we might be able to mirror.\n\n3) seeing the gain/loss percentage for stocks they bought between the transaction date and the current date would be neat too. If they sold the stock before the current date it'd be nice to see how they did.\n\n4) on the rows where they sold stock, seeing the gains/losses would be nice. Idk if you have enough data to make it perfect but you might be able to estimate it?\n\n5) being able to sort the politicians by how successful their trading has been would be beneficial. Then you'd know which ones you should pay more attention to.  Success in this case could be the stats in #2 and 3. Sorting my short term gains and longer term gains would show different things",

The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores,\u201d wrote Schultz, who served as the company\u2019s chief executive three times prior.\n\n\n. . . . \n\nStarbucks\u2019s shares were down around 30% in the last 12 months. Over the same time frame, the S&P 500 is up more than 20%. \n\nIn his Sunday post, Schultz said Starbucks executives and board members needed to spend more time working in cafes, and help to reinvigorate the chain\u2019s mobile ordering and payment systems. Starbucks needs to invest in coffee-focused drinks when it comes to new products to stand out among competitors and highlight its premium spot in the marketplace, he said.\n\n\u201cThrough it all, focus on being experiential, not transactional,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nSchultz said he was confident that the company could turn around, but cautioned against doing too much too soon.\n. . . . \n\nEnd quote\n\n\n\n",

The lines are so long because the orders are way too complex combined with the online order priority. Not to mention, starbucks comes with  a language barrier. If you arent a regular itll take you forever to order because the lingo is so whacky. Then the pressure to tip is the cherry on top.

        "post_body": "\nJeronimo Martins is a Portuguese corporate group that operates in the food distribution and specialized retail sectors. The stock appears to be an attractive investment opportunity based on its strong financial performance and undervalued share price.\n\nProfitability:\n\n- Jeronimo Martins reported a 16% jump in Q4 2023 net profit, with a net profit of \u20ac198 million. This indicates the company was profitable in 2023.\n\n- For the fiscal quarter ending in December 2023, the company reported EPS of \u20ac0.32. For the trailing 12-month period, Jeronimo Martins' EPS was \u20ac0.32 as well.\n\nBalance Sheet:\n\n- Strong asset base with significant fixed assets and rights of use.\n\n- Moderate debt levels with net debt of \u20ac2.1 billion\n\n- Healthy shareholders' equity of \u20ac3.1 billion\n\nCash Flow:\n\n- The company generated strong operating cash flow of \u20ac2,240 million, up from \u20ac2,095 million in the previous year.\n\n- Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures, was \u20ac1,041 million in 2023.\n\n- This represents a decrease in free cash flow compared to the prior year, likely due to higher capital investments.\n\nSector Growth:\n\n- Jeronimo Martins has experienced robust growth across its key food retail and distribution business segments, particularly in its discount store operations in Poland and its emerging market presence in Colombia\n\nValuation:\n\n- Jeronimo Martins is currently trading at a discount to its intrinsic value and is considered an undervalued stock by multiple analysts and valuation models.\n\n- Jeronimo Martins' current P/E ratio is around 16.7, which is lower than its P/E of 21.6 at the end of 2022. This suggests the stock is trading at a discount compared to its recent valuation.\n\nSummary:\n\nJeronimo Martins appears to be a well-performing, profitable, and growing retail conglomerate, with its stock currently trading at a discount to its intrinsic value, suggesting potential upside for investors.",

                "comment_body": "I'll start by saying fair play for bringing to the subreddit an investment idea out of the normal ones often posted here.\n\nI think  it's important to be able to stand over and justify your approach to approximating \"intrinsic value\" so I wanted to offer a counter opinion to yours that at present Jeronimo Martins is undervalued as in my opinion it is not.\n\nAnd the approach I take to approximating business values, assuming the company is earning sufficient industry / market returns on its invested capital, and is not in distress, i.e. ruling out asset based valuations, is to use a sales comparison approach to approximating business value, in order to determine whether any / a sufficient margin of safety exists between the purchase price and value being received.\n\nSo with that in mind, my first observation, when googling very quickly \"supermarket acquisition  \nmultiples\" is an observable range of between .10 - .50 times sales being paid to acquire supermarkets.\n\nThis would make sense to me, given the low operating / profit margins earned on their sales, which in turn is made up for by a much larger asset turn over ratio, as supermarkets turn over their inventory almost monthly. Also the spread between .10 - .50 price range may reflect the financing / amount of leverage and its cost in the deals used to establish this price range.\n\nTo sense check this valuation range a further google search shows that in 2023, Auchan Portugal signed an agreement with Grupo Dia to acquire its Portugese supermarkets for \u20ac155m, which generated \u20ac826m in sales, equating to a purchase price to sales of .187. So this validates the range.\n\nAnd a few years ago, Jeronimo Martins acquired a chain called Discount plus stores, paying \u20ac320m for a chain delivering \u20ac493m in sales, the deal being fully financed by debt. The price to sales ratio then paid was .64, or outside the range but not a million miles away.\n\nI suspect given the fact the deal was done in 2007 just before the financial crisis and fully financed by debt, that the price to sales ratio of .64 reflected top of the market valuation, and most likely does not reflect, normalized prices for supermarkets.\n\nCircling back to Jeronimo Martins then, given its size (\u20ac30,608,000,000 in 2023 sales) any acquirer would likely have to finance the deal almost entirely with debt, meaning they most likely would pay at the higher end of the price range. So let's say for argument a price to sales ratio of .4 is appropriate.\n\nOn that basis, Jeronimo Martins would command an enterprise value, through acquisition of some \u20ac12.4b from which its net debt of c. \u20ac998m would need to be deducted, leaving us with an equity value of about \u20ac11.2b.\n\nWith a present market cap of \u20ac12,334,142,800, it looks to me to be moderately overvalued on the basis of my approach.",

                "comment_body": "Now you could argue that given its size it should command a price to sales ratio closer to the one it itself paid for Discount Plus stores, but the whole point of approximating margins of safety is to take the conservative point of view.\n\nUsing a price to sales ratio outside of the .10 - .50 range observed, whilst resulting in an equity value above its prevailing market price suggesting it is undervalued, leaves you with no margin of safety whatsoever and so strikes me as too aggressive an approach to pricing it using this valuation method.\n\nAlso Jeronimo Martins has delivered an average annual net income margin of 2.4% over the last 10 years  \nwhich is in line with competing supermarkets (Aldi, Mercadona etc). Walmart's average annual net income margin for the same period is 2.5%, so any synergistic value that may be added to my price is slim, as it's already earning net income margins, comparable with industry participants.\n\nIts a shame Aldi's acquisition price of Winn Dixie has not been made public as I think this would have given another valuable pricing data point, into the business values for supermarkets being acquired.\n\nYou could argue that a financial acquirer (i.e. PE type fund) might look to acquire it on the basis of a sale and leaseback transaction (assuming it owns most of its real estate) at a higher price than mine, but I discount acquisition multiples paid by these players, given their own investment returns are financially engineered, and thus the prices they pay, do not reflect what business owners / operators would pay for the same business.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if an infrastructure fund took the view that supermarkets represented a quasi form of infrastructure asset, given their stability assuming conservative management, and on that basis, may pay a price higher then mine.\n\nJust Look to KKR's recent acquisitions of smart water metering companies at truly eye watering multiples. Or equally, over in England, look at the acquisition of Asda by the Issa Brothers in partnership with TDR, who have significantly levered their supermarkets and petrol station / forecourts, using sale and lease backs in order to pay down some of the leverage. They acquired Asda for an enterprise value of \u00a36.8b from Walmart, when Asda had sales of \u00a320.4b, equating to a price to sales ratio of .33, again validating the valuation range suggested.\n\nSo it has been done, but their target rates of return, leverage ratios and cost of financing again do not reflect what industry acquirers would be capable of / willing to pay for similar assets.\n\nThese are really the only two ways I could see an aggressively higher price than mine (other than an all stock acquisition assuming the acquirer's PE ratio was sufficiently high, say 33+ meaning an implicit cost of financing of 3%), but again one is straying away from the principle of margin on safety, but I include them out of interest for one to think about.\n\nIf I could offer a suggestion to your approach to valuation, two points stick out to me.\n\nThe first is that outsourcing the valuation to analysts and models is not really valuation at all. As an investor you need to do the valuation work yourself, however approximate the results may be. The whole point of the approach is not to be precise, but to find an idea so obvious that even if you are significantly off in your estimates, you still make money / get your money back.\n\nYour second point, about the fact that on a relative basis Jeronimo is undervalued today, because its trading at a lower PE ratio to its historically high PE ratio is not a justification for investing today. The economic conditions that created the historically higher PE ratio may have justified it then.\n\nConsidering the past 2 - 3 years involved abnormal COVID profits for some industries and much lower interest rates capitalizing them, its perfectly reasonable for a business today to be trading at lower multiples than its recent historic highs, as inflation is reducing corporate profits and higher interest rates today are lowering the present value of their future profits.\n\nThe purpose of estimating, and it really only is estimating intrinsic value, is to protect the capital your laying out and aside from my business valuation which I've offered, I don't see any real estimate of intrinsic value in your approach, I think you need to address that going forward for yourself.\n\nSo I commend you for the idea and bringing it here and I hope my approach gives you some food for  \nthought. Its one that works well for me. I'm not trying to be a Debby Downer so please don't take my comment as such.",

Analyst upgrades, momentum etc\n\nIn the first, companies like Morningstar will do just that, find out what is a fair value of the company, and tell you what is range to buy to have a margin of Safety.\n\nIn the Second, companies like IBD looks at RSI, and CFRA ( S&P global) looks at others which I suspect is analysts ratings etc.  in addition to the fundamentals.\n\nSo for a company like Zoetist, a Pharma company for animals, Morningstar has a rating of three stars, ie. it is at or near its fair value price of 170 and the five star price is 119. Whereas CFRA gives it a 12 month target price of 161 and a \u201cHold\u201d rating.\n\nFor me personally, because I buy and hold for the long term, I prefer the first approach, where RSI/Momentum/upgrades/downgrades aren\u2019t as important. \n\nMy opinion obviously.",

Upon approaching a certain age some people may switch to safer securities and have to reallocate their savings. For example, at the age of 55 a person slowly increases the share of bond etfs in his portfolio and plans to reach 60% of bond allocation till 60 y.o. (and retire soon). Later deallocation stage starts when a person does not work any more and just spends savings.\n\nDuring the first allocation stage if is better not to sell at all - it is a pure buy and hold. To reallocate assets or spend your savings you have to sell but you may make it really slowly.\n\nAs for me, I decided to use such basic selling strategy. I sell only if closing a position improves the diversification of the portfolio and on some basic signal (like SMA 200).",

When I consider my margins and ROIC for the forecasted period, they are stable, aligning with historical margins/ROIC. But when I consider the reinvestment rate it is much lower than previous periods.

Its turnover is 0.5x, and it is levered 1:1 on its equity, so its ROE is 30%.\n\nNow, let's say we forecast the possibility to grow sales by 10% per year. How much capital would the company have to reinvest to meet this opportunity? Assuming their 15% ROIC continues on the incremental capital (and depreciation roughly approximates maintenance capex requirements), the company would have to reinvest 20 cents (10% more capital) to make 3 cents more in profit (or 30% on 10 cents, or 10%, additional sales). But it made 30 cents this year, so it would only have to reinvest ~67% of its earnings to meet this revenue opportunity.\n\nTo save you some time, look at your model and see how growth divided by ROIC compares to the reinvestment rate in each year ;)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDid you forecast lower-than-historical revenue growth?!...",

Initially, our net present value (NPV) of Unlevered Free Cash Flows is positive when discounted at the WACC.\n\nHowever, when we transition to analyzing the same cash flows as shareholder cash flows, or levered cash flows, by subtracting interest and debt repayments and discounting with the equity required return of 9%, suddenly the NPV turns negative.\n\nHere's where my confusion arises: How can we interpret the initial positive NPV as implying that both debt holders and shareholders are being compensated, yet the transition to levered cash flows suggests that shareholders aren't being adequately compensated? what I am missing here ?\n\nthank you !",

The logic behind dumping this business is that the remaining business mix will have organic revenue growth of 4-7%. \n\nI do not recommend buying the shares until the kidney disposal is final and even then I want to see what the new business mix looks like.

        "post_body": "\\*This is my first attempt at a deep dive analysis before in this area. Be kind, please. =)\n\n**Too long and don\u2019t want to read:** Tapestry/Capri\u2019s merger is likely to go through regardless of the FTC\u2019s lawsuit. The deal has been approved in all other jurisdictions and the main argument the FTC is making is a stretch that would require the Judge to interpret the law that would likely impact many other mergers. Buying Capri\u2019s stock for $35/share could see a $22/share return if the deal is allowed to close.\n\n**Background**\n\nTapestry proposed to  \nacquire Capri Holdings back in August 2023 for $8.5B. If neither of those  \ncompanies sound familiar, the brands they own: Michael Kors, Coach, Jimmy Choo,  \nVersace, and Kate Spade among others probably do. This merger would create a  \npowerhouse in the Luxury Goods space. \n\nFTC Commissioner, Lina Khan, wrote a paper back in 2017 while at Yale that spelled out a need to rethink anti-trust rules in the United States. Right now, anti-trust is primarily focused around the consumer and how a transaction impacts them. Khan argued that wasn\u2019t enough due to the changing landscape where companies like Amazon use other tactics such as using artificially low prices to clear the market of competition.\n\nWhen Joe Biden took office, he nominated Khan for FTC Commissioner. She promised to more thoroughly bring action against mergers and acquisitions that harm competition. However, if you look at her tenure, she has lost all of the cases the FTC took to trial. The DOJ also has been on the losing end more often than not, but they do have wins such as blocking the Simon and Schuster/Penguin Random House and Spirit/JetBlue mergers. Other prominent mergers such as Microsoft/Activision Blizzard have been able to go through despite objections from the FTC/DOJ.\n\nThe reason for these losses is simple: while the regulators are looking more thoroughly at anti-trust cases, the actual law hasn\u2019t been changed by Congress. Therefore, if a company is willing to go to Court to fight for their merger, they have a high chance of winning. What Khan is hoping to achieve is stopping mergers from happening due to companies not wanting to deal with the cost and time it\u2019d take to see the merger through. And she has had success in getting companies to abandon merger plans such as Illumina/Grail. Illumina chose to abandon the deal instead of continuing to litigate the issue in Court despite the 5^(th) Circuit rebuking the FTC\u2019s original case.\n\n**Capri/Tapestry**\n\nWhen the deal was announced, Capri rose to $53/share, less than 10% away from the $57/share merger price. Despite everything I listed above, that showed the confidence in the deal getting approved. The main reason people were optimistic that this would be an easy approval was that the need to protect consumers in the luxury retail industry isn\u2019t as high as other industries.\n\nHowever, in April 2024, the FTC announced they were suing to block the merger. Since the stock peaked, it has come back down to the $35/share level the stock was at before the merger was announced.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0**The FTC\u2019s Main Argument**\n\nThe FTC makes several arguments, most of them I think have an insignificant chance of being successful. For example, they argue that the employees of the companies could be impacted negatively. This is ,a pretty ridiculous argument without much precedent and is unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe main argument they make actually uses a term created by Coach: \u201caccessible luxury\u201d, specifically in the handbag space. Accessible Luxury is a term used across the fashion industry to describe luxury products that are priced somewhere between mass market and traditional luxury brands. Essentially, you can get a high quality product for a reasonable price. \u00a0\n\nThey are specifically referring to the handbag product line because everything else would be a major reach that competition would be impacted. The idea that this deal would impact other consumer areas like clothing, watches, shoes, etc. is even more ridiculous than the claims they are making that it will impact the handbag industry.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s whole argument centers around this \u201cAccessible Luxury\u201d definition holding up in Court. If the Judge calls BS, this argument falls apart because none of the brands owned by either company, even in the aggregate, would put a big enough dent in the market to justify anti-trust action. According to Statista, Coach makes up 13% of the handbag industry. That\u2019s hardly enough to justify stopping this deal in my opinion.\n\n**Miscellaneous Items**\n\nSome think the biggest risk is what I said earlier about the FTC\u2019s strategy: that Tapestry will decide it\u2019s no longer worth it and terminates the deal. Based on my research and other people who would know better than me, Tapestry cannot terminate the deal unless there is a Material Adverse Effect (MAE). MAE is a circumstance or event that severely harms the value of an asset. The merger being challenged wouldn\u2019t qualify for a MAE. An example of a MAE would be if a company lost a key customer, or if fraud was found that lowered revenue, or if there was major product recall. Tapestry couldn\u2019t use the FTC\u2019s legal battle as a MAE because Capri\u2019s value hasn\u2019t been impacted significantly\n\nThis deal has been approved in all other jurisdictions including the EU and Japan. Therefore, the FTC is really going at this alone. Again, it shows the ridiculousness of this whole thing.\n\nThe judge, Jennifer Rochon, was appointed by Joe Biden. I think that has also caused some uneasiness. If this was a 50/50 issue, I\u2019d agree. For reference, the judge that blocked the Spirit/JetBlue deal was appointed by Ronald Reagan. The President who nominated them doesn\u2019t always dictate how a judge is likely to rule. Capri/Tapestry have the facts on their side in this case.\n\n**How to Play**\n\nYou could simply buy the stock and wait. You could use options either to hedge or speculate. The difficulty is predicting the timing. The trial is supposed to start in September 2024. The judge has said she wants to keep the trial moving.\n\nIf the deal for some reason doesn\u2019t go through, Capri is still a stable business. It would likely take a hit, especially because their results haven\u2019t been good lately. I\u2019d estimate their share price would drop to around $25-30/share.",

Risk is 2-1 but merger arbs probably won\u2019t touch this until it\u2019s through the courts so we probably continue drift lower going into the court case.

However if the merger does not go through Capri can get hurt pretty badly.  Just look at IRBT and SAVE etc. to see what could happen after an aborted takeover.",

                "comment_body": "Good research above, however, there are somethings I would consider:\n\n1. I think it is not a leap for the judge to see \"accessible luxury\" as a distinct market given both the company and industry experts look at it that way. It would be hard for TPR to fight their own definition of the market. I actually see a lot parallels between this and JBLU/SAVE. SAVE is an ultra low cost carrier which is an \"accessible airline\". Moreover, given the precedent of protecting consumers who prefer ULCCs it is not a leap to say that the government and court would be protecting consumers who prefer the prices of \"accessible luxury\".\n2. Michael Kors, Kate Spade, and Coach are all American brands and make the majority of their revenue in North America. I would give less weight to the approvals from the EU and Japan given the market in those countries are smaller and do not constitute an antitrust issue. The combined company would be a clear antitrust issue in the \"accessible luxury\" market in the US.\n3. One thing I can't really grasp with this case, is what the benefit to consumers are. Usually in these cases, if there is a significant lessening of competition there are benefits that the companies would highlight that outweigh those issues. However, I have yet to see one for this particular merger.\n4. Also, I would highlight that the decision FTC to block was unanimous (3 democrats and 2 republicans). You would expect this case to be down party lines given it is about handbags and not really on anyone's list. Given it was unanimous, there is a high likelihood that somewhere in the redacted text there are hot-docs that is currently non-public.\n5. Finally, given a lot has changed in the industry since the deal was announced, TPR is currently significantly overpaying for CPRI and there is a high likelihood that the deal would get re-struck so your upside may not be $22/share. The MAE could result from a divestment prescribed by the FTC for them to settle before trial.\n\nI would be hesitant of arbs where the deal spread is so high, there is usually something the market does not like.",
