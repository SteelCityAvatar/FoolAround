I beleive its very underrated metric.  **Retained earnings** represent the cumulative total of earnings that a company has yet to pay to shareholders and is found on the Balance Sheet.  While the number itself is less important - what is important to me is the overall trajectory of retained earnings - i.e its growth and growth rate.\u00a0 I want to see the retained earning growing from year to year hopefully at a rapid pace.\u00a0 Typically I look at least 5 years of retained earnings.

SLB also adds their carbon business to the JV for 0.5B NOK which is around the remaining cash Aker has now.\n\nHave been trying to wrap my head around what this means for investors in Aker.

        "post_body": "Alphabet and Microsoft are sending a clear message to investors: AI and Cloud Computing are two industries that are paying off.\r  \n\r  \nBoth companies released their earnings, and let us tell you, they did GREAT. Alphabet surged as much as 12%, pushing their [valuation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-parent-alphabet-reclaims-spot-2-trillion-valuation-club-2024-04-26/)past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose by as much as 3.5%, which is an impressive gain for them. \r  \n\r  \n**The Main Details:**\r  \n**Alphabet:**\r\n\n* New cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, the first in the company's history. \r\n* The board of directors also approved stock buybacks of around $70 billion. \r\n* Total revenue rose 16% from the same period last year.\r\n* Earnings per share beat estimates: $1.89 vs $1.53 expected.\r\n* Cloud revenue rose 30%, and Ad revenue rose 13%.\n\n**Microsoft:**\r\n\n* Total revenue rose 17%, and Profits rose 20%.\r\n* Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected.\r\n* Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud Segment rose 21%.\r\n* Azure and other cloud services rose 31%.\r\n* LinkedIn revenue rose 12%, Xbox revenue rose 62%, and PC revenue rose 18%.\n\nBoth tech titans are locked in a battle over the dominance of the AI field, but it seems as yesterday's results show that the market thinks these two companies have room to grow together.\r\n\n**Generative AI**\r  \n2024 is the year of generative AI, and it looks as though technology that can create text, images, and videos with prompts is here to stay. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAi to challenge Google\u2019s two-decade dominance of the internet, but Alphabet's own generative AI, Gemini, isn\u2019t too far back. \r\n\nThe space is becoming competitive, with both Alphabet and Microsoft executives saying their generative AI programs are driving more business for their cloud computing services. Corporate customers are also more open to making long-term investments in cloud infrastructure, increasing their trust in both companies.\r\n\nGenerative AI is giving a reason for corporations to come back and continue to use the cloud services of their company of choice. This gives the volatile tech industry some stability, with new demand and revenue coming in for both companies. \r\n\n**Google\u2019s Trailing Cloud Services** \n\nThis new intake in demand for cloud computing is a welcome turn for Google, which has long lagged behind industry veterans Amazon and Microsoft. After breaking even for the first time last year, the unit is now viewed as one of Google\u2019s fastest-growing businesses and best bet for growth as its core search advertising unit matures. Google\u2019s cloud operations pulled off a first-quarter profit of $900 million, well above analyst predictions of $672.4 million. \r\n\n**Gemini Comeback**\r\n\nGoogle\u2019s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks it had in the generative AI consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model, formally known as Bard but now rebranded to Gemini, was criticized for answering prompts with historically inaccurate images, promoting the company to stop generating pictures and depictions of people with its software.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since that obstacle, Google has been able to turn things around with Gemini. The enterprise product has told a very different story as the professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help ensure that the content released by the model stays consistent with their brand messaging to avoid mistakes like in Q1. Enterprise Gemini can be used to produce ads, videos, and podcasts.\r  \n\r  \n**Microsoft's Domination**\r\n\nThe narrative has been completely different for Google, with domination from the get-go. Generative AI has been an avenue for enterprise clients to spend more with Microsoft. The tech company has been infusing AI into the entire core product line with its technology partner OpenAI. \r  \n\r  \nThe bet is starting to pay off as customers are adding Microsoft\u2019s AI tools to help summarize documents and generate content. Alongside the addition of Copilat, Microsoft reported a 31% climb in revenue for its Azure cloud computing program, beating analysts expectations. 7% of this increase was attributed to AI which is a big deal. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub coding platform is also gaining more traction, recording 1.8 million new customers during this period an increase from 1.3 million of last quarter. This is largely due to their AI-coding assistant powered by OpenAI\u2019s largue language model, helping programmers streamline their code, answer any questions, and even convert code from one programming language to another. \r  \n\r  \nThe company is also seeing a large intake in their AI assistance tool meant to work synonymously with their Office suite software. The new tool costs companies an extra $30 a month on top of their existing subscriptions. Corporate customers are many in number including Goldman Sachs, Ford Motors, and Ernst & Young. Microsoft estimates that roughly 60% of the Fortune 500 uses Copilat.\n\n*Btw I wanna give credit where it's due:* [*This analysis was from here*](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe) ",

That\u2019s changing in small increments, and they\u2019ve basically reached saturation in those realms bordering on defeating the function of their products.

HOWEVER, Google are still 30:1 PE with little growth opportunities, beyond cramming in more ads into existing mature products. Between the two, Google is overvalued unless they change how they do business.\n\nPersonally, META looks better priced (PE wise) than Google, plenty of opportunity and zero growing competition, except maybe MSFT buying TikTok US arm\u2026.",

But that can't go on forever and then its probably going to be a price war, which decreases their margins. \n\nGoogle Search has amazing margins cause they can basically ask what they want cause there is no competition, but with cloud im not so sure.",

That's $200 billion and only growing as the demographic shift continues to favor streaming over broadcast, and youtube continues to grow in international markets in ways that other streaming platforms have struggled. I see no reason YT couldn't itself be a $1 trillion company in the next decade. \n\nMy concern is google cannibalizing its #1 revenue driver of search by providing AI answers that supercede any links. Not to mention consistently the AI just gives me wrong instructions on how to do things (I searched how to create a circular crop in Preview on Mac and the AI generated answer was straight up telling me to do things that weren't possible).",

Meta is basically putting a search system in all their apps now. Their Rayban AI glasses are a huge hit too and these AI agents overall with all the other companies doing the same will change the way we search for information or products. \n\nIn a couple years people will tell their AI glasses to buy the product they are looking at instead of Googling it or use one of the 10s of AI agents. Like some people are locked in to ChatGPT and they have announced they will add search into the app as well.\n\nGoogle sheet docs and Gmail are great but don't drive any revenue and definitely not the margins. Even YouTube is said to still lose Google money.",

I personally don't use Meta yet but Chatgpt took away 50% of my Google activity overnight.\n\nOnly reason Google didn't feel that financially yet is because you can't search for products or services on Chatgpt yet. Once they add that im curious how many of those 200m users will do that in Chatgpt going forward instead of Googling it.\n\nI'm not saying these companies will all take over Google completely, but what is the chance Google keeps their 90% market share? Close to zero imo. Whether it drops to 20% or 70% is what I dont know. \n\nI dont believe what no one is going to use Meta Search instead of Google going forward. You're in the app already and see something you wanna buy. Instead of going out of IG, FB or WA you just search it directly in app. \n\nIt used to be impossible to get into the search business for many search because it was a winner takes it all business.

        "comment": "I mean it's the basic math of it being repaid like you would expect, including interest, and then it depends on its risk weighting in proportion to how much capital they would need to put in reserve. Also if at any point repayments are late, then impairments are recognised. E.g. under IFRS 9 rules it can be in 3 risk weighting stages, stage 1 is fine, stage 2 you need to recognise a %  as impairments but can still recognise interest payments, stage 3 large % is impaired and interest it put into ECL (expected credit losses). So basically if the borrower is prime and repays fully its quite simple, but subprime gets complicated as you recognise losses upfront, but they will be later adjusted depending upon what actually happens. IMO its why credit as a % of GDP is far less to sub prime since 08 as banks simply aren't as profitable. Whereas mortgages still very safe and lucrative, but competitive.",
