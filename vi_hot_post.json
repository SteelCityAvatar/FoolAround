        "post_date": "2024-04-28T18:25:49",
        "post_body": "Cooper-Standard, a leader and global suppliers of sealing systems and component, fuel and brake delivery, and fluid transfer systems was a pre-pandemic money tree cranking out over $8 EPS. During the pandemic, when global light vehicle production was cast into the depths of hell, multiple competitors within the space were forced to close shop; although $CPS remained afloat it did not come out unscathed. Instead, the stock plummeted into freefall, and was down over 90% from it's all-time high. But like my grandma says, when there is blood in the streets, buy real estate. And gentlemen, I have opened $CPS as my largest position and it's my 2024 best-performer pick. Let me explain why.\n\nDuring the pandemic, global light vehicle production volumes fell to a low of 77.6 million units in 2020. Mr. Fu Bingfeng, President of OICA, described the sharp downtrend as \"the worst crisis ever to impact the automotive industry.\" Due to being inherently dependent on light vehicle production, Cooper Standard's top line was obliterated. They went from an untouchable EPS and EBITDA monster to complete stagnation.\n\nWith production annihilated, it is no surprise that eight auto parts suppliers filed for bankruptcy between 2020 and 2021. While Cooper-Standard survived the chaos, revenues declined by over 35%, and shareholders experienced a 90% drop in share price. During the post-pandemic recovery, another major headwind emerged. The UAW strike once again halted light vehicle production for three of Cooper Standard's largest customers. Today, these obstacles have been successfully navigated, and the ascent to reclaim the throne has never been more clear.\n\nLight vehicle production is now on a tear for a multitude of reasons. First, the average age of a vehicle on the road is currently sitting at an all time high of 13.6 years. That coupled with the fact that current domestic auto-inventory sits at 1.4 months (meaning the current stock of automobiles could only supply 1.4 months of sales) creates a huge impetus to start cranking out vehicles. And vehicle production = $CPS profits. Better yet, the vehicle production numbers from Q1 2024 are significantly exceeding consensus predictions. In every month in 2024 to date, vehicle sales have been significantly higher than in 2023. In March alone, vehicle sales were more than 100,000 units greater in 2024 than in 2023.\n\nThis boom in vehicle production and sales has lifted all major automakers than have already reported 1Q earnings, as they continue to beat and raise guidance.\n\nAs far as the financials are concerned, $CPS revenue and adjusted EBITDA show a clear inflection point in 2021, and with leaner costs from restructuring, coupled with the vehicle production turnaround, $CPS is poised to head to the moon gentlemen. Despite the clear path forward, the stock continues to trade \\~85% lower than its ATH. A major reason for this was the conservative guidance set forth by management at the Q4 earnings call, but during the call, the CEO of the company himself said, \"*Clearly, our light vehicle production units and the guidance that we've used for '24, you can see there are -- continue to be a bit conservative, I guess, is how I would describe it.*\" Well, the numbers coming in so far for 24 are far from the conservative estimates put forth by management, and I expect a resounding beat will be the result at their Q1 call in two weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: As mentioned above, I have opened a position in $CPS and as always do your own DD.",

No, that is why you need to look at unlevered returns for an apples to apples comparison. Also, a large investor (e.g. private equity) can simply buy out the company and change the capital structure.

                "comment_body": "Just to add to what others have said:\n\n1) it\u2019s so that you can evaluate the business on its own merits.  Financial engineering is a real thing, compare a property rental company where they can buy assets with either 100% cash or 10% cash and 90% debt - the debt holders only receive a fixed income while any profits above this go directly to the shareholders after taxes, which means the return on investment can be hugely affected by the debt levels.  Therefore the merits of the business itself can be distorted by debt.\n\n2) It gives a clearer picture on how much debt a company can repay.\n\n3) Debt can distort the apparent value of a company, especially when using an earnings multiple as a valuation technique (e.g. a PE ratio). There are a few different ways that this could cause an error in judgement here: a) say EBIT is $100 and interest $90 leaving a profit of $8 after tax (at 20%), if companies in this industry are usually valued at a PE of 15, then you might think that the company should be worth $120 ($8 x 15).  But what if the company only has a year or two left on its loans?   Then the value would be radically different.  b) Another scenario, using the same figures above, is what if the company is growing very rapidly?  Using the same multiple to value both the business and the debt would clearly be an error in valuation. i.e. if earnings before tax in the following year is $200, the year after that $400, and the year after that $800, and if the debt and interest rates have remained unchanged at  just $90 interest per year, then applying an earnings multiple to the after interest figure would probably under value the company.\n\n4) A company is made up of the business itself (the assets, working capital, staff etc) and how it is financed (capital structure).  Debt is very easy to place a value on and usually the balance sheet figure is sufficient, though there can be exceptions that I won\u2019t get into.  So why complicate your evaluation of a business when you can simply deduct the debt at the end of your evaluation?  Having debt in the evaluation complicates things unnecessarily.  Again, there are exceptions, especially if the company has either significant debt - where a closer examination of the cash flows would be required, or very little debt - could be ignored for simplicity purposes.",
