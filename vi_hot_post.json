Hence, falling stock price can only play into their favour. Or maybe then just have some extra fat that they mind burning as a YOLO. \n\nHence, we cannot argue that the decision of Bershire to invest into $SIRI can be a signal predicting that the stock will overperform the market in any near future.",

        "comment": "I get it, you are long this and you think you understand it. I wish I did too. I have nothing against replicating Buffett moves, but there is a huge risk of getting burned if we don\u2019t understand what the heck the move is and replicate only a part of it. With something like AAPL, it\u2019s simple. This, not so much. Remember, we can\u2019t see everything. We can mostly only see long positions. \n\nI initially thought this was an arbitrage play. Like ATVI. That makes sense if the price of SIRI doesn\u2019t keep deteriorating to below any advantage the arbitrage would have offered. If this was a pure arbitrage play, it already didn\u2019t work. \n\nIf this is a bet on SIRI, which it seems to be since they are also long SIRI itself, I can see the advantage in snapping up cheaper shares in LSMXA/K. But then again, they seemed to have timed it poorly so far and any advantage those shares offered was nullified. They would have done better to wait until after the merger to buy shares from all the people selling because they are not interested in the new share structure. \n\nBut then, they insist on these purchases despite all the above. Is it because BRK is too big to buy a large part of the float over a short period of time and is using this tactic to disperse its purchase? In that case, we would benefit from playing this like a Greenblatt merger play. Or is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nThere is no doubt SIRI is great value here IF it can return to consistent revenue growth.",

        "post_body": "I have been trying to wrap my head around this for two days. AkerCarbonCapture (ACC.OL) has 4.25NOK market cap currently. They recently announced entering a joint venture with SLB. The deal is SLB pays them 4.1B in cash and they keep around 0.4B of company cash. In return, they move their operations to a new entity where Aker keeps 20% ownership and SLB 80%. SLB also adds their carbon business to the JV for 0.5B NOK which is around the remaining cash Aker has now.\n\nHave been trying to wrap my head around what this means for investors in Aker. Do they hold a share of this cash in exchange for a 5x dilution in the new joint venture company? Or is it something else? \n\nAppreciate any answers from anyone who had something similar. Details on the joint venture here: https://newsweb.oslobors.no/message/614772.",
