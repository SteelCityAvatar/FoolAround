Operational cost from scale is not a long term moat.  First mover is an advantage only if it blocks competitors out - which in history has been a geographic or network effect story.\n\nPeople don\u2019t switch from Apple ecosystem because of what they would lose.  Facebook has a similar network effect advantage.  Msft has high barriers to change because all the devs would need retraining to move away from Msft enterprise.  Google is at risk but there is an intersection of tools and monopoly that make it the gorilla you HAVE to work with.  All of these tech companies are actively working to leverage their strengths to defend their moats and make them stronger and integrate with AI.\n\nIs there anything similar wrt AWS?  Network effects?  Lots of investment on their customers side that would have to be redone?  An obvious pathway to staying ahead of the surprise innovation out of left field that takes out the scale advantage?\n\nI get the arguments on the shopping portal side, but that business has not been terribly profitable in history.  I don\u2019t see where the durable moat is wrt an industry (cloud compute) that is racing towards commodification with competition that can afford to sell cloud at a loss because of the benefit they get from integration with all of their other datasets and services.\n\nAny high margin business attracts competition.  Everyone races to innovate and in the process prices tend to crater.  Eventually it becomes a commodity market.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to prove you wrong, I\u2019m genuinely trying to understand this idea that Amazon has a durable moat.  Is it some sort of proprietary container code that can\u2019t be replicated?  Is there some specialized knowledge and an army of workers that would need retraining?  Is there a patent that gives Amazon a durable cost advantage?  Why would companies (cloud customers) be willing give their supplier strategic pricing power over their bottom line?  What is stopping a lower cost producer from taking share with better operational tech?\n\nI\u2019ve heard this idea that all the aws container code would have to be rewritten.  Why couldn\u2019t an LLM do that?\n\nWhat is preventing competition from taking business from Amazon?  What will prevent commodification?",

Amazon is a very misunderstood company and people underestimate the near-impossibility of penetrating their moat. \"If you can't see it, don't buy it\" is something I always use when discussing Amazon and Google. \n\nI'm 100% convinced they have broken economics/capitalism. Not in the sense that they're gonna collapse the system, no, in the sense that they have achieved such an immense size and expertise their moat in some core activities is literally impenetrable. That's cloud servers and same day delivery network for Amazon and Search/Android/YouTube for Google. \n\nThere is just no viable way for any possible competitor to challenge them because interest rates will never be 0% again. Amazon built a fully in-house logistical powerhouse only rivalled by the US military with free money for years while they hemmoraged cash. Now they are optimising for profit and you can see FCF just blowing though the roof. If there is gonna be a $10 trillion dollar company it's gonna be Amazon.\n\nThere are lots of good Reddit threads about Amazon, I'd say read up on them. But if you can't see it, don't buy it.",

        "post_body": "Cooper-Standard, a leader and global suppliers of sealing systems and component, fuel and brake delivery, and fluid transfer systems was a pre-pandemic money tree cranking out over $8 EPS. During the pandemic, when global light vehicle production was cast into the depths of hell, multiple competitors within the space were forced to close shop; although $CPS remained afloat it did not come out unscathed. Instead, the stock plummeted into freefall, and was down over 90% from it's all-time high. But like my grandma says, when there is blood in the streets, buy real estate. And gentlemen, I have opened $CPS as my largest position and it's my 2024 best-performer pick. Let me explain why.\n\nDuring the pandemic, global light vehicle production volumes fell to a low of 77.6 million units in 2020. Mr. Fu Bingfeng, President of OICA, described the sharp downtrend as \"the worst crisis ever to impact the automotive industry.\" Due to being inherently dependent on light vehicle production, Cooper Standard's top line was obliterated. They went from an untouchable EPS and EBITDA monster to complete stagnation.\n\nWith production annihilated, it is no surprise that eight auto parts suppliers filed for bankruptcy between 2020 and 2021. While Cooper-Standard survived the chaos, revenues declined by over 35%, and shareholders experienced a 90% drop in share price. During the post-pandemic recovery, another major headwind emerged. The UAW strike once again halted light vehicle production for three of Cooper Standard's largest customers. Today, these obstacles have been successfully navigated, and the ascent to reclaim the throne has never been more clear.\n\nLight vehicle production is now on a tear for a multitude of reasons. First, the average age of a vehicle on the road is currently sitting at an all time high of 13.6 years. That coupled with the fact that current domestic auto-inventory sits at 1.4 months (meaning the current stock of automobiles could only supply 1.4 months of sales) creates a huge impetus to start cranking out vehicles. And vehicle production = $CPS profits. Better yet, the vehicle production numbers from Q1 2024 are significantly exceeding consensus predictions. In every month in 2024 to date, vehicle sales have been significantly higher than in 2023. In March alone, vehicle sales were more than 100,000 units greater in 2024 than in 2023.\n\nThis boom in vehicle production and sales has lifted all major automakers than have already reported 1Q earnings, as they continue to beat and raise guidance.\n\nAs far as the financials are concerned, $CPS revenue and adjusted EBITDA show a clear inflection point in 2021, and with leaner costs from restructuring, coupled with the vehicle production turnaround, $CPS is poised to head to the moon gentlemen. Despite the clear path forward, the stock continues to trade \\~85% lower than its ATH. A major reason for this was the conservative guidance set forth by management at the Q4 earnings call, but during the call, the CEO of the company himself said, \"*Clearly, our light vehicle production units and the guidance that we've used for '24, you can see there are -- continue to be a bit conservative, I guess, is how I would describe it.*\" Well, the numbers coming in so far for 24 are far from the conservative estimates put forth by management, and I expect a resounding beat will be the result at their Q1 call in two weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: As mentioned above, I have opened a position in $CPS and as always do your own DD.",

Since 2019, management had made cuts that have contributed $479 million to adjusted EBITDA. They have improved operating efficiencies with smaller fixed cost structure, have higher margins on EVs due to them requiring 20% more content per vehicle, and renegotiated contracts with customers.  In short, they\u2019re making more money on each car manufactured, we were just waiting for production to ramp up (which the Q1 vehicle sale numbers so far suggest has already started to happen.).  These sales numbers are approximating 2018 levels DESPITE interest rates remaining high, imagine what car sale volume will look like once rates are.\n\nThe debt is primarily long-term debt, which allows Cooper Standard to ride the tailwinds current in place within the automotive industry and pay back that debt as the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",

                "comment_body": "Just to add to what others have said:\n\n1) it\u2019s so that you can evaluate the business on its own merits.  Financial engineering is a real thing, compare a property rental company where they can buy assets with either 100% cash or 10% cash and 90% debt - the debt holders only receive a fixed income while any profits above this go directly to the shareholders after taxes, which means the return on investment can be hugely affected by the debt levels.  Therefore the merits of the business itself can be distorted by debt.\n\n2) It gives a clearer picture on how much debt a company can repay.\n\n3) Debt can distort the apparent value of a company, especially when using an earnings multiple as a valuation technique (e.g. a PE ratio). There are a few different ways that this could cause an error in judgement here: a) say EBIT is $100 and interest $90 leaving a profit of $8 after tax (at 20%), if companies in this industry are usually valued at a PE of 15, then you might think that the company should be worth $120 ($8 x 15).  But what if the company only has a year or two left on its loans?   Then the value would be radically different.  b) Another scenario, using the same figures above, is what if the company is growing very rapidly?  Using the same multiple to value both the business and the debt would clearly be an error in valuation. i.e. if earnings before tax in the following year is $200, the year after that $400, and the year after that $800, and if the debt and interest rates have remained unchanged at  just $90 interest per year, then applying an earnings multiple to the after interest figure would probably under value the company.\n\n4) A company is made up of the business itself (the assets, working capital, staff etc) and how it is financed (capital structure).  Debt is very easy to place a value on and usually the balance sheet figure is sufficient, though there can be exceptions that I won\u2019t get into.  So why complicate your evaluation of a business when you can simply deduct the debt at the end of your evaluation?  Having debt in the evaluation complicates things unnecessarily.  Again, there are exceptions, especially if the company has either significant debt - where a closer examination of the cash flows would be required, or very little debt - could be ignored for simplicity purposes.",

Given the current market scenario (high-interest rates), I would like to inquire if it is advisable to invest in corporate bonds? If so, could you kindly recommend some suitable options? Additionally, I am contemplating whether to adopt a step-ladder pattern by purchasing bonds with varying maturities, such as 2 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 10 years, or simply focus on 10-year bonds. I would greatly appreciate your insights, as I am in my 40s and seeking to make informed investment decisions.\n\nThank you.",

With BHP's recent bid being rejected and the pe firm Elliot Management announcing a billion-dollar stake in the company, it seems likely that the stock is set to run with a future offer having to be significantly more than the initial bid. However, there are still some uncertainties, particularly regarding the potential need for Anglo American to spin off significant portions of the company. Even at $16.40, the shares still appear undervalued to me given an imminent sale. I'm curious to hear if anyone else has any thoughts on this.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/activist-investor-elliott-builds-1-bln-anglo-american-stake-bloomberg-news-2024-04-26/\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bhp-consider-improved-anglo-proposal-after-bid-was-rejected-bloomberg-news-2024-04-27/",
