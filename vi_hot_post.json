I've got my eye on a few value plays that seem promising.\n\nFirst up, I'm watching WBA closely. They've been beaten down lately, but their fundamentals still look solid. With the recent management shakeup, there might be some positive changes coming.\n\nAlso keeping tabs on some energy stocks. With all the geopolitical tension, oil prices could spike, and some of these undervalued energy companies might see a nice bump.\n\nAnyone else spotting any good value opportunities out there? Always keen to hear what others are seeing in the market.\n\nHappy hunting, value investors!",

If China\u2019s acquisition of Kazatomprom (world\u2019s largest producer) is successful, expect further exacerbation of supply disruption. \n\nUranium is only 5% of a reactor\u2019s operating costs, so plenty of room for upside as cheaper to buy expensive uranium vs shutting down reactor.\n\nLong term, more reactors are being built/restarted (like 3 mile island) than decommissioned.

Most end up just burning all the cash and then raising more capital or going under. A few break through and see big gains, but most don't. Trading at cash is a busted way to view these stocks because you're not accounting for the fact that the cash is constantly being depleted, and that is the literal business model.\n\nIn other words, don't apply basic value metrics to profitless development stage biotech CO's. It's just a different business model more similar to venture capital.",

If energy consumption increases without a corresponding increase in supply, price of energy goes up for all, including manufacturers and service providers. The price of bread is influenced by energy costs, even basics such as milk. Building out more energy infrastructure takes time, and also requires political consent. You cannot just build nuclear power stations next to people\u2019s homes without those people crying about it. So basically the supply side is very slow to adjust; so it\u2019s probably inflationary. How much, depends on demand. Of course, Mag 7 will claim they have their own energy supply but that\u2019s bullshit, they will just compete for energy with the non-AI sectors of the economy.",

While the net income for the twelve months ending June 30, 2024, showed significant growth of 142.5%, the quarterly data for Q2 2024 revealed a decline of 6.89% compared to the previous quarter. This inconsistency in net income growth poses a challenge to sustained profitability.\n\nSimilarly, the free cash flow for the twelve months ending June 30, 2024, experienced a substantial decline of 70.17%. The quarterly data for Q2 2024 also showed a decrease of 53.9% in free cash flow. This decline in free cash flow can impact the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives and maintain dividend payments.\n\nAnalyst estimates for CVS's EPS indicate a cautious outlook for the near future. The mean EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, is $6.54, with a slight increase to $7.34 for 2025. While these estimates suggest some growth, the company needs to address its current challenges to meet these expectations and ensure dividend sustainability. \n\n# CVS Health Reportedly Considers Sale of Its Insurance Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is considering the sale of its insurance business. The possibility of splitting the pharmacy chain from the insurance business, called Aetna, is under consideration by the company's board. The sale plan comes after the firm came under pressure from investors for a structural realignment.\n\nAny stock purchase now and your losing the value of the insurance segment which was a significant portion.\n\nAetna, as part of the healthcare benefits segment, contributes significantly to CVS's gross income, accounting for about 31.08% of the total revenue.",

Larger investment firms can\u2019t grow as fast because there are less investments big enough to have a meaningful impact on the firm. \n   - Also partly due to Buffett\u2019s age, he\u2019s cognitive ability at 94 just can\u2019t be the same as what it was when he was in his mid 70\u2019s.\n\nQ2. Money manager or Businessman.\n   - Both. Buffett accumulates the cash from the businesses owned by Berkshire and allocates it into either the other more promising businesses they own or new investments. To understand which businesses are better to inject capital into though, you need to be somewhat of a businessman as well. But if you\u2019re wondering if he \u201cruns\u201d a company like a regular CEO, not really. \n\nQ3. Ackman\u2019s outperformance.\n   - Opposite to Q1.

While sg&a cost climbed up their \"new\" exuberance faded and now they will die (market cap of 500m, debt of 1bn). Beyond meat is toast.\n\nThe technology of \"synthesizing\" something. I've studied this for the last 2 years, spoke with the top guys at Glanbia, Sadafco, Alfa Laval, (those 3 are doing the same as the 3 french !) project in the middle east to cut dependencies on Yili (the queen of all dairy stocks).\n\nAs Yili took over the thrown of New Zealand (Fonterra/synlait) as New Zealand was the 1 top milk exporter in the world. \n\nYili bought out New Zealand because of all these c02 emissions. New Zealand killed their main export product and didn't have the technology to syntheticcally make it.\n\nSadafco/Glanbia/Alfa Laval do, and they are building a factory in Algeria as we speak as it's the most milk importing country. \n\nMichelin/bank/Danone think more local European competitions. So it's not \"creating new\" it's literally FTE salary to polish a diamond strategy to higher levels to compete with the Yili and Pirelli of this world. Pirelli delivers tires by Petrochem so Michelin knows exactly what margin requirement enhancement they need for out pricing Pirelli. \n\nThat will happen. Because albeit the amount sounds low, you need to think of equations basically. The bank then comes in as collateral to *sponsor* once completed. \n\nBecause you can syntheticcally create fake rubber. It's enhancing of that formula. But also for syntethic dairy, synthetic milk, cheese, and Nestle is eagerly waiting to jump in (European band wagon) as this technique is nestled in Europe starting at a company called Methrom Ag\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrohm\n\nThese guys did what Beyond Meat did 20-30 years ago. I happen to know ex co workers of Methrom and blistering barnicles they are clever. They only cared about their production but when I heard them laugh how they finally \"convert funghi into fake burgers while we had that technique 20 years ago\" my ears went wait wait wait, now I get it. Because the European market is trying to reduce reliability on China. And not as country alone, no also Chinese stocks. \n\nPirelli might be Italian, it's chairman is CEO is Chinese of an oil company.\n\nThe main shareholders are Chinese state owned funds. Pirelli is \"Chirelli\". And the Chinese do these reverse mergers often but also - once there isn't any profit to be found, they will dump Pirelli at the get go. \n\nSo very short on New Zealand\nDairy Yili will decline as take a look at the DEBT Yili carries. European dairy makers now this and once Yili margin diminishes they will find themselves in the same problem as Beyond Meat.",

You can't easily replicate Amazon or Costco's distribution networks. You can't easily replicate META, Microsofts, Google, or Apple's network effect. Few competitors in an industry is also likely a sign of a competitive edge that will prevent new entries into the industry. \n\nQualitative ways to see the effects of competitive advantage are a high return on capital employed or invested capital. Another would be the cash flow generated from fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment). Think of it this way. Apple has about $110B in PPE and produces about a $100B in free cash flow annually. You could theoretically build Apple for $100B and generate nearly 100% returns if you could simply copy Apple's business. So, why can't cash flow heavy businesses simply copy Apple's business? Because they can't. Apple has a massive competitive advantage. Growing market share is a good sign of a companies competitive advantage.",

It\u2019s a practice that gets one to understand why consumers would switch from a company or not. I\u2019s argue there\u2019s no right way to go about it, but the more you do it, the better you get at it.\n\nAs per types of moats, there are so many different types of moats, which you can learn here: https://cxl.com/blog/economic-moats/amp/\n\nAs a brief explanation, moats can happen because of: \n1. The **investment the consumer has in a company** (take Google Workspace for example: hard to move to [Microsoft](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/MSFT) if all your emails and files are within the [Google](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/GOOGL) environment), \n\n2.**Scale and low cost** due to large operations: think energy companies, internet providers, airlines, and even retailers like [Amazon](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/AMZN) and [Costco](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/COST). Companies where so much money and even complying with so much regulation is needed,\n\n3. **Network Effect:**similar to #1, but consumers are using a company because other people are. Think marketplaces such as Airbnb, social medias such as [Meta](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/META)\n\n4. **Branding:**especially durable in consumer companies. Coke, Costco, LMVH, etc.\n\n\nThere\u2019s more.\n\nFor tech companies specifically, on the B2C side, it\u2019s about how hard a company can make for its users to switch from their product and branding.\n\nB2B is the same, plus adding scale (think data centers, for example) and branding.",

While you are looking at MGPI which makes whiskey barrels, I had a small tracker position in Jack Daniel\u2019s maker BF.B, and I sold it off recently after holding it for 9 months. \n\nI sold it because sales volume wasn\u2019t increasing at all. Management discussed that the possible reasons could be (a) weed (b) gen z (c) ozempic but ultimately they decided that the reason for the lower volume sales was because of elevated inventory at the retailers that needs to be drawn down. (Similar to the reasons given by MGPI)\n\nHowever I am not convinced this is a Company-specific issue as Diageo is also having the similar problems, their higher end tequila is slower to take up, their international efforts are being hampered by issues.\n\nWhile I do think people will comeback to whiskey and while BF has had long periods of no growth (prohibition), I think it will take a while to sort it self out.",

I took a look in January but passed on valuation (was at 30x earnings) but now I\u2019m kicking myself!\n  \nThe doggone earnings keep growing! Last quarter operating income was up over 60% year over the year in dollar terms, and 80% year over year in yen terms. It hasn\u2019t grown less than 50% year over in yen terms in any year since the end of COVID. \n  \nSanrio\u2019s business model is pretty unique and interesting. They make a \u201ccharacter\u201d like Hello Kitty and then license them out for clothes, cards, stuffed animals, etc. They also license out the tv show production but have some say in the creative development to make sure the characters stay true to brand. The Hello Kitty character currently accounts for about a third of gross profits but historically has been as much as 70% of gross profits. \n  \nThe incremental margin with this business model is huge. As the popularity of the characters expand, the margin expands - little incremental costs for each additional licensed good, and the extra licensing revenue drops to the bottom line. \n  \nNot cheap at 42x earnings, but seems like a candidate for \u201cwonderful business\u201d that could be bought even at an elevated multiple. I\u2019d probably still wait for something a little lower on the multiple, but with its current growth rates maybe this kind of multiple is reasonable. \n\nCurious for others thoughts and any anecdotes on the popularity of hello kitty or other Sanrio characters!",

Hello Kitty's been around forever and still going strong, but they've got a whole stable of characters to milk. \n\n42x earnings is steep, but if they keep growing at 50%+ it might not be crazy. The key is whether they can keep pumping out popular characters and expanding globally. \n\nI've seen Hello Kitty stuff everywhere from Asia to the US, so they've got solid brand recognition. My kid's obsessed with Gudetama (the lazy egg character), so they're definitely still relevant with the younger crowd.\n\nMight be worth keeping an eye on for a pullback, but missing out on 100% gains stings.

I use that as a proxy since I'm not going to have time to research the management team qualitatively. \n\nIn summary, I along with other main metrics (bvps, eps, revenu, fcf) I also give good amount of importance in roic. My rule of thumb is checking if the roic is consistently over 10% over years, then I consider it as good roic, if it's even higher than 10% and consistent it's even.\n\nHope this helps!",

        "post_body": "**Worksport Ltd.** (NASDAQ: $WKSP), a leader in innovative automotive accessories and renewable energy solutions, has recently announced an accelerated path to profitability, driven by a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing operational efficiency. The company expects to achieve over **$2 million in projected savings**, a move that will significantly strengthen its financial position and provide stability as it prepares for upcoming product launches.\n\nThis cost-saving initiative comes at a crucial time for Worksport, which is set to launch key products such as the **TerraVis\u2122** solar-powered tonneau cover and its associated **energy storage systems**. These products are designed to capitalize on the growing interest in renewable energy and sustainable technologies within the automotive sector, aligning with the global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy solutions.\n\n# Key Highlights of Worksport's Financial Strategy:\n\n1. **$2M+ in Projected Savings**: The company\u2019s management has taken decisive steps to streamline operations and reduce overhead costs. This initiative is expected to generate over $2 million in savings, which will be reinvested into core business areas, including R&D, manufacturing, and market expansion.\n2. **Strengthened Financial Stability**: By enhancing financial efficiency, Worksport is positioning itself to weather market fluctuations and focus on long-term growth. This stability will be particularly important as the company enters a critical phase of product development and commercialization.\n3. **Upcoming Product Launches**: Worksport is preparing to introduce its flagship **TerraVis\u2122 solar tonneau cover**, which integrates solar energy capture and battery storage for pickup trucks. Additionally, the company's energy storage systems are set to disrupt the renewable energy market, offering sustainable solutions for both vehicles and off-grid applications.\n4. **Accelerated Path to Profitability**: The cost-saving measures, along with the anticipated revenue from new product launches, are expected to accelerate the company's path to profitability. Worksport is focused on scaling production, securing strategic partnerships, and expanding its market presence to drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.\n\n# Positioning for Growth in Key Markets\n\nWorksport\u2019s unique combination of **automotive innovation** and **renewable energy technology** places it at the intersection of two rapidly growing markets. The global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy presents significant opportunities for the company, especially as consumers and industries look for sustainable solutions.\n\nWith its upcoming TerraVis\u2122 system, Worksport is positioned to become a key player in the renewable energy and EV sectors, offering truck owners the ability to harness solar power while on the go. The company\u2019s energy storage systems also provide a promising entry point into the broader energy market, with applications beyond automotive use.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWorksport\u2019s announcement of **$2 million in projected savings** signals a proactive approach to financial management as it prepares for the rollout of innovative products like the TerraVis\u2122 solar tonneau cover. By strengthening its financial stability and focusing on sustainable growth, Worksport is poised to accelerate its path to profitability while tapping into the lucrative markets of renewable energy and electric vehicles.\n\nFor investors, the company\u2019s strategic cost-saving measures and upcoming product launches represent a compelling opportunity as Worksport moves closer to becoming a leader in the green automotive and energy sectors.",

Additionally, the rest of the semis right now are showing weakness so I would avoid unless you know and understand what you\u2019re getting into. \n\nI would stay away from ford, they are having all kinds of issues right now and if consumers continue to weaken, it\u2019s not a company that will do well. \n\nI think Nike is an interesting one, as well as a company like Disney, depending on your outlook. \n\nHope this helps and let me know if I can expand on anything for you.",

All they do is repeat their mantras of chronic underinvestment without actually  taking an unbiased view of the supply and demand fundamentals.\n\nI say we are headed towards a 2015-style shakeout in the industry, and I am definitely not putting any money into the industry on this side of the crash.",

The acquisitions occurred when commodity prices were high (cause that\u2019s when these family businesses usually sell). The debt load is going to come down hugely over the next year or so since SAF production will be fully running and capex will fall off a cliff. Over the past year or so the commodities that darling sells have been depressed as well which is represented in the movement in the stock over the past year+.\n\nBuying darling is essentially capturing spread like revenue on the following long-term themes: \n\nworldwide protein consumption increasing (darling processes like 1/7 animals in the world post slaughter), \n\nconsumer health products (Collagen + Collagen based glp-1 suppressants)\n\nSustainability - huge into SAF production and renewable diesel\n\nLastly animal fat rendering capacity in the world is simply not being created at the same rate as protein consumption is increasing. Many of what is stated on the balance sheet is most likely trading way below replacement costs.\n\nDm if you have more questions",

        "post_body": "I previously posted about SLRK here \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/gCxLMVIu1u\n\nTL;DR the company has got horrible corporate governance, and the ceo/chairman has historically used the excess cash to buy airplanes so he can fly to all the Denver Nuggets games. He has a social media presence as \u201cthe red pant man\u201d. There is currently a lawsuit from shareholders to audit the assets, get him to sell the planes, and hopefully institute a dividend. \n \nHowever they are darned good bankers. They kept leverage low during the long period of low interest rates, then ratcheted up lending and purchases of loan pools and bonds during 2022-2023 when rates were high. They then have sold off some of these loan assets and bonds as interest rates declined in 2024. \n  \nThe efficiency ratio is great, now under 40% which is insane for a small bank. They have a really interesting self directed IRA business which allows IRA holders to invest in real estate through their IRA and lets the bank attract a lot of non interest bearing deposits.  \n  \nBook value is now $20.74, putting P/Book under 0.5, and the company earned $1.28 per share THIS QUARTER. If they annualize anything like this the stock is still under 2X PE ratio. \n  \nI know I\u2019m probably gonna regret trusting the red pant man and the Twitter bank crew hates SLRK, but I have to hold my nose and hold this one. My thinking is the lawsuit is dragging everything out in the open and eventually the bank will have to start allocating the excess cash in a more shareholder friendly manner, or management will do a buyout and take the bank private.

Like the polar opposite of wallstreetbets (also funny for its own reasons). \nI've just been getting into investing and trying to look for value investments.\n\nI came across AREC, they have good patents on reusing precious metals used for batteries, magnets etc. Turning used lithium back to 99,8% capacity for example. Very useful in today's society and considering the push to go green and America's push for local winning of these precious resources, it's an interesting stock. \n\nIt went up about 70% last month, sadly I got in a bit late and it's been dropping a little this week. But I do believe it could be a great stock with a healthy long term growth. They've been expanding every year with new plants and recently they've started working together with other companies in the field (Iris metals, and Vulcan elements). And with the increase of electric vehicles, need for magnets etc, there could be a lot of increased need for their product. \n\nHow do others see this stock? \nWhat other things could you look at when assessing a stock like this for its potential?

Either way, I believe it could be a good long term investment if you're willing to follow it closely and your time horizon is far. After paying down all this debt, I could see them initiate a divy. \nAt some point I think it will become an acquisition target because they really have the best shows and netflix and/or amazon will want to buy them outright instead of paying for their shows.",

Its no question that network TV is dying, the question is just how fast.  Then, to offset this, how fast can they grow different revenue stream like direct to customer such as Max.  FCF-wise the company looks undervalued but this FCF is likely in decline due to the above mentioned revenue decline from linear.  Its good that they payed off a massive amount of debt the past 2 years, but the debt levels are still really high and again, will they be able to keep up the same pace of debt repayment if their cash flows decline?  Probably not.  And if they're hyper focused on paying down the debt, that leaves less money to direct towards investments to grow.\n\n  \nAnyways, that being said, I recently started building a position \\~$8 but its a small position and I consider it a speculative play for the turnaround story.  I think MAX has plenty of room to grow internationally and seeing that Disney+ also finally reported a profitable quarter for streaming gives some hope in the streaming business for other companies not named Netflix.  Its one of my gamble picks for now and I'll be picking up some more shares if it drops a bit more in the $7 range.",

Of course there are risks - the exist anywhere - of AI disruption and such, but I believe they have a great core product and a great management team and a fantastic brand.\n\nI\u2019d actually love to see Alphabet spin out a few companies now or in the future. YouTube tops the rankings for minutes of content watched by consumers daily in a lot of markets, it has subscribers and ad revenue that is almost the same size as Netflix, but is stuck inside a 23x PE company while the market values Netflix at 38x. Waymo is running tens of thousands of driverless taxi rides per month, while Elon Musk is trying to hype the idea of driverless taxis inside his 56x PE company. I\u2019m not sure either Netflix or Tesla are worth those valuations\u2026! But that\u2019s where the market has trended, and you\u2019d suspect those businesses alone could bring a lot of future value to Google shareholders.\n\nAmazon for the reasons discussed by others here - they\u2019re just a flywheel that\u2019s accelerating.

Their competitive moat is broader, thanks to dominance in e-commerce, cloud (AWS), and growing investments in AI. Plus, with Google expected to lose significant search engine market share, potentially dropping from 60% in 2024 to around 50% by 2025. Which is where they make like 80 percent of there revenue, but there cloud infostructure is growing steadily and profit is increasing there. However, Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on the shifting landscape. As Google faces increased competition, Amazon\u2019s diversified business model and constant innovation could fuel their growth even more.",

That way I can address things such as liabilities on a more precise way. \n\nBut when Im lazy (which u should never be), I do rely on analyst reports but ask myself the following: are they understimating or overestimating this company and by how much? \n\nSometimes they value a company at 100\u20ac and I think they are underestimating their growth perhaps but a few points but the stock is trading at 50\u20ac. That\u2019s still a buy. \n\nIt could also be that they think it\u2019s worth 60 but I think is worth 50. If the stock is trading at 50, I wouldn\u2019t buy it because my margin of safety without doing my own math calculations should be way generous\n\nSometimes they think a company is worth 40\u20ac and I know enough to know it\u2019s worth at least 80. If the stock is trading at 50, I\u2019ll buy it\n\nWhen I do my own math, I have a lower margin of safety. I can buy a company at 44 if I think is worth 50\u20ac (conservatively). \n\nThat\u2019s the reason I havent buy AMSC, I still have to do my own math.

        "post_body": "I see a lot of people talk about free cashflow as if it's more important than earnings. I don't really understand why. \n\nThe main difference is how capex is treated. Net income smooths capex over time by depreciation and amortisation. Free cashflow would instead recognise the entirety of this capex in the current period.\n\nIf your company needs to buy a machine which costs $10m, and must be replaced every 5 years, the effect on free cashflow would be -10, 0, 0, 0, 0. Whereas net income would be -2, -2, -2, -2, -2. \n\nI can't see any sense in looking at the cashflow in the years when the capex is not occurring and drawing any long term conclusions from it. Yes, there is money available for shareholders now. But in year 6 there won't be, and you'll probably be taking on debt or getting diluted if they have been distributing prior.\n\nAnd I've seen people say, \"ah, well if the company/industry is capex intensive I'll adjust for it\". But earnings have already done that for you lol. Adjusting out, adjusting in... talk about making work for yourself.\n\nAnd another one - \"D&A don't recognise the true costs accurately, because book values are not the same as market value\" - okay this one has some validity. It is true that the value of the machine on the books does not necessarily reflect its market value, or replacement cost. The methods by which D&A recognises costs (usually straight line), are very simplistic. But it is better than lumpsumming the costs into the current period, i.e. it is better than a cashflow perspective.",

FCF tells you what the company is bringing home for investors today, while NOPAT is more informative about tomorrow. FCF removes capex, which is important information to consider; is the company investing for tomorrow, or is it keeping cash and distributing it to investors? You tend to see that FCF-to-NOA is inversely correlated to accruals-to-NOA, because either a company is keeping its cash, or it's reinvesting its cash. Reinvesting its cash leads to lower FCF, even though it's often better for the investor. NOPAT tells you how much the operations are bringing in, regardless of whether the cash is being invested. FCF is informative, but if I had to choose, NOPAT and RNOA are better indicators than FCF and FCF-to-NOA.\n\nThat said, high accruals can be a sign of poor earnings quality. Keep an eye on how quickly accounts receivable is growing in relation to revenue. While I like seeing relatively high accruals-to-NOA and low FCF-to-NOA, it can be an indicator that management is being overly aggressive about revenue recognition.",

Moreover, if FCFF is - 20, it's gg cause now u need to know exactly what the firm is spending on if not ur just burning money on a stock pick.\n\nI know what u mean, net income smoothes out the inconsistency and fcf takes into account of inconsistencies such as one time capex, whereby NI to a certain extent represents the normalised version of the business. However, what's great about fcf is that is that u can see \"exactly\" what the business is doing and earning, whereas NI could hide cash expenses behind accounting methods.\n\nTake ur example, if - 2 - 2 - 2 -2 -2 on an income statement. What do we know as investor? The company spends -2 in accounting earnings on D&A but that's not very accurate right. We are not spending -2 every year. We spent - 10 in first year and 0 in second year. You could smooth - 10 out 5 years but what ur doing is essentially making up expenses for the next few years. \n\nIf I bought 10 dollars worth of eggs today, how much did I spend? I spent 10 dollars for 20 eggs, that's what happened right, you can't hide and make stuff up, 10 dollars left my wallet. I did not use the accounting method and say actually \"you know what bro, I actually did not spend 10 dollars, I actually spent 50 cents because I used 1 egg today\". As I highlighted previously, u can smooth it out but what ur doing is assuming and forecasting expenses that are not real ur basically hiding ur expenses to a certain extent and slapping it onto the income statements.\n\nGoing back to ur question, you can technically see how this would lead to how much actual cash ur earning because net income hides ur real earnings, fcf does not hide how much u make. As a result, you can better value the company. I could go further on valuation but maybe later if you want an explanation on fcff and net income deviations.\nBut ur kinda right to a certain extent depending on the situation of the company whether it's growing or declining and selling its assets. But idt u know why ur right imho cause if you knew why ur right, u would not be asking this question. U would know the difference between accounting and cash income and how both would impact valuation depending on the company's growth stage and the it's impact on capital.",

There are situations where either can be misleading so you should always consider both. \n\nTake a super capital intense business like Enbridge, I don't own any stock but it's a decent example. Their payout is continually over 100% based on net income but they aim to return 70% of distributable cashflows. \n\nAnother example is companies that have to report MTM hedging, like with annuities and some insurance. Jackson Financial is a good example, it has had very good quarters from a cashflow and operational perspective but in the past has reported wild results from a GAAP perspective.",

As long as returns on invested capital are double digit, and consistently high and or growing, and pretax earnings to key generating assets are well above 50%, then it really doesn\u2019t matter as much how much cash is going to capex, or how much in terms of growth vs maintenance, since they\u2019re clearly generating a meaningful and efficient returns against it. Owners earnings is still the best measure. But backing out capex as a whole annually is ridiculous and unrealistic. Annual averages/medians, or even using depreciation should be close enough for a business like that with consistent outflows in those areas. Analysis is not a precise science, analysis can be close enough, which is fine so long as you\u2019re bracketing reality. If you can take 4 and 4 and get reasonably close to 8, (7 or 9) then that\u2019s all you need. Close enough to accurately gauge business performance and make informed decisions is sufficient, it doesn\u2019t need to get down to cents on the dollar despite how many say otherwise. \n\nAnyone who arbitrarily backs out all of capex doesn\u2019t understand how businesses meet their capex needs and financing gaps, and they don\u2019t understand how to analyze a business, they only understand how to find certain figures and run with them using a blanket approach. Ignoring how a business meets its capex, or how capital intensive the business is, by simply not looking down the cash flow statement is not only lazy, but completely ignores the nuances of how capital is allocated and how resources for capital are utilized. If you can\u2019t explain that because you just looked for free cash flow, then you don\u2019t know the business. You\u2019re just following a recipe at that point and not thinking about what\u2019s cooking.\n\nToo many in this value investing group are just blindly formula plugging, or relying on superficial metrics with tunnel vision.",

Particularly focused on de-escalation and decision making in stressful situations. 95% retention rate and good reviews plus a subscription service to their proprietary software with no meaningful competitors means that if this tech is widely adopted this company would have a moat.\n\nAt this price, the valuation looks great. The stock is beat up because they had a bad Q1 & Q2 which the CEO blames on international orders and pipelines being very slow. Added to this that federal funding is slow to release. But there is interest and these deals should be finalized this year or early next year. \n\nPlus they are launching a new VR headset which has gathered a lot of interest in the community. They will begin shipping towards the end of Q3 which should serve as a catalyst for future growth.   \n  \nFeedback appreciated. Valuations and more points included in the blog post. Thank you!\n\nDetailed post: [https://prateekmalhotra.substack.com/p/vtsi-virtra-inc](https://prateekmalhotra.substack.com/p/vtsi-virtra-inc)\n\n",

Unfortunately there really isn\u2019t a market for this stuff, or they likely would have been acquired by Axon already.\n\nIf you like this space wait for Axon to pull back.

It was interesting watching it rocket 18% in one day during the China stimulus drama and then crater since then.    Haven't decided to dip in yet.  The risks of companies associated with China are talked about ad nauseum but it seems that headwinds related to the solar industry are somewhat behind them at this point? Or am I way off base?  I suppose another big catalyst is the upcoming US election of course.\n  \nI mean, CSIQ shareholder equity is more than double it's market cap right now...  \n  \nSo...value or value trap?

Your price is set by your the quote of the stupidest competitor. You must beat that persons rate in order to get any business. \n\nValue investing is about jumping over the shortest hurdle possible to earn a return on money with little to no risk of loss.

Thereafter there was a change in the controlling shareholder. But there was no new business ventures and the group continue with the bedding and steel operations for many years\n\n\n\nAbout a decade ago, the group started to divest its steel business so that today it is left with the bedding operations, its investment in China and lots of cash. \n\n\n\nIn Dec last year, the controlling shareholder pass away and his son has taken over the management of the group. Nothing new has happened so far but I hope that with a new person at the helm, there may be a change in the business fortune.

        "post_date": "2024-10-18T03:41:58",
        "post_body": "Coastal Financial Corp ([CCB](https://stocknear.com/stocks/CCB)) is set to report its Q3 2024 earnings on October 29th, 2024, before the market opens. As the financial sector prepares for the update, CCB\u2019s fundamentals and performance suggest this regional bank could be a value investment opportunity worth considering. Here's a closer look at the key data.\n\n\n\nKey Earnings Expectations:\n\n* **Projected Revenue:** $154.27M (YoY growth of 59.36%)\n* **Projected EPS:** $0.95 (YoY growth of 26.67%)\n\nThis marks a continuation of strong earnings momentum, with the bank showing robust growth in both revenue and net income over the past several years.\n\n\n\n# Financial Overview:\n\n* **Market Cap**: $816M\n* **EPS (ttm)**: 2.75\n* **Beta**: 1.24\n* **Shares Outstanding**: 13.46M\n* **Short % of Float**: 3.31% (Short Ratio: 4.95 days)\n* **Institutional Ownership**: 59% (with BlackRock holding 8%)\n* **Forward P/E**: 10.28\n* **P/E Ratio (ttm)**: 22.07\n* **Average Volume**: 66.15K\n\n\n\n# Stock Performance:\n\n* **YTD Return**: CCB up 31% vs. S&P 500\u2019s 22%\n* **1-Year Return**: CCB up 38% vs. S&P 500\u2019s 34%\n* **3-Year Return**: CCB up 6% vs. S&P 500\u2019s 5%\n\n\n\n# Fundamental Ratios (Annual Trends):\n\n* **PE Ratio**: 13.21 (decreasing over the last two years)\n* **PS Ratio**: 1.78 (also decreasing)\n* **PB Ratio**: 2.0 (decreasing as well)\n* **Price/FCF**: 3.1\n* **Price/OCF**: 3.0\n* **Return on Equity**: 15%\n* **Return on Capital**: 11% (with 80% growth YoY)\n\nThese declining valuation ratios combined with improving return metrics point toward an undervalued stock that continues to deliver value to shareholders.\n\n\n\nFinancial Strength & Growth:\n\n* **Revenue**: $330M (35% YoY growth)\n* **Net Income**: $44M (8% YoY growth)\n* **Free Cash Flow**: $190M (66% YoY growth)\n* **Long Term Debt**: $47M (a 10% decrease YoY)\n* **Total Liabilities**: $3.49B (16% YoY growth)\n\nCoastal Financial's solid revenue growth, strong free cash flow generation, and the reduction of long-term debt reflect prudent financial management and a growing business model. While liabilities have grown, the debt reduction is a positive sign for long-term sustainability.\n\n\n\n# Forward Outlook (FY26 Estimates):\n\n* **Revenue**: $1B (from current $330M)\n* **Net Income**: $100M (from $44M)\n* **EBITDA**: $328M (from $57.13M)\n* **EPS**: 7.43 (from 3.27)\n\nAnalysts project substantial growth over the next two years, with a tripling of revenue and more than doubling of net income, which, if realized, would significantly improve the stock\u2019s valuation and earning potential.\n\n\n\n# Valuation and Conclusion:\n\nWith a **forward P/E of 10.28**, CCB appears attractively valued relative to its earnings growth. The decreasing P/E, P/S, and P/B ratios, along with significant returns on equity and capital, underscore that this is a company in a growth phase while trading at value-friendly multiples.\n\nFor long-term, value-oriented investors, Coastal Financial offers a compelling case of strong financial health, consistent earnings growth, and an appealing valuation compared to its future growth prospects. As we approach the Q3 earnings call, CCB could be worth keeping on the radar.\n\n\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: Coastal Financial ($CCB) is demonstrating strong revenue growth, declining valuation ratios, and a robust outlook, all while outperforming the broader market. As earnings approach on October 29th, it may present a compelling opportunity for value investors.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on CCB\u2019s growth trajectory and current valuation?\n\n  \nPS: Research data are from [Stocknear](https://stocknear.com/)",

        "post_body": "[https://www.thetigersprey.com/p/lz](https://www.thetigersprey.com/p/lz)\n\nLegalZoom is yet another interesting story. After all, how is a \\~1.2bn company connected with O.J. Simpson, Kim Kardashian, Jessica Alba, and Kobe Bryant, all in completely unrelated ways?\n\nAs someone with a legal background, it\u2019s impossible not to recognize Robert Shapiro as one of LegalZoom's founders. Shapiro was part of O.J. Simpson's \"Dream Team\" of attorneys, who famously led to his acquittal in what is often called the \"trial of the century.\"\n\nBrian Lee, another co-founder, partnered with Kim Kardashian and Shapiro to launch\u00a0ShoeDazzle\\[.\\]com, and later teamed up with Jessica Alba to create The Honest Company. Finally, Jeff\u00a0Stibel, LegalZoom's newly appointed CEO, co-founded Bryant\u00a0Stibel\u00a0with NBA Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant.\n\nEnough with celebs. Let\u2019s focus on the stock!\n\nWithin months of the initial Covid-induced lockdowns in 2020, new business applications, a key indicator of future business formations, rose and have since remained above pre-pandemic levels. As business formations serve as a gateway for customers to access LZ\u2019s broader ecosystem, the question is whether there will be a regressions towards pre-pandemic levels, and to what extent.\n\nWhile the relationship with job quit rates have proven to be spurious, other factors have contributed to this growth, including trends in remote and hybrid work, the proliferation of alternative income streams (e.g., NIL, influencers, and freelancing), the improvement of digital enablement tools (e.g., gig platforms), and the availability of SMB loans and grants. Weighing these factors, I predict a limited regression, after which business applications will resume growing at MSD-to-HSD rates.\n\nAdditionally, Jeff\u00a0Stibel, the newly appointed CEO, argues that LZ \u201cshould be tethered to the recurring services needed by millions of small businesses, well beyond the formation and regardless of where \\[they\\] sit in the macroeconomic cycle.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as the new freemium model \u201ccontinues to resonate in the market,\u201d the adoption of higher-value, post-formation products, primarily subscriptions, is expected to accelerate, lifting ARPU closer to its potential.\n\nAt the same time, the ongoing shift in the revenue mix toward subscriptions is expected to structurally drive margins higher over time. For context, subscription revenue gross margins are assumed to align with software peers in the 70%-80% range, while partner revenue, now included within transaction and subscription revenue, is recognized at gross margins close to 100%.\n\nIn light of these points, LZ is unjustifiably trading at a significant discount to SMB SaaS peers. Among these competitors, INTU stands out as particularly relevant, as its QuickBooks solution directly competes with LZ Books, while its TurboTax product previously competed with the recently reoriented LZ Tax.\n\nOn top of trading at an all-time low from a time-series perspective, the current 7.9x discount to INTU seems highly compelling in light of the fundamental acceleration LZ is about to experience. Instead, a 5x to 6x discount, corresponding to a multiple more representative of the broader market, would be more appropriate.",

Average is very sensitive to outliers.\n\nI would suggest you also use a perpetuity terminal value just for sanity check, it is very easily to inflate the terminal value when using multiples, especially during periods of high valuation. For example, Coca-Cola trades at x26 earnings but it is growing at 1-3% annually so slapping an 26x multiple will get you a far higher terminal value compared with a perpetuity terminal value.",

I\u2019m considering reallocating some positions, specifically exchanging ADBE and MSFT for META and ORCL. Both have been trading near recent highs, so I\u2019m cautious about the entry point.\n\nMy rationale:\n\nMETA: Despite the highs, I see long-term potential in their AI and Orion glasses, which could drive further growth. However, I\u2019m hesitant to enter at these levels without more insight into a potential pullback.\n\nORCL: Similarly, with their cloud computing and AI focus. However, it too has been trending upwards, and I\u2019m weighing whether I should wait for a better price point or go in now.\n\nI\u2019m also keeping an eye on SMCI given its strong fundamentals and recent momentum, as well as other opportunities like ASML and CRWD, which have seen recent pullbacks.\n\nWhat do you think about?\n\n",

You wanted a big database in the 90s, you paid the big bucks for Oracle DB. They could do all sorts of things that cheaper databases like SQL Server couldn't. Over time, SQL Server, Postgres and other databases caught up. And I don't know of any companies who are rolling out \\*new\\* Oracle DB. I've worked on systems where a company had an old Oracle DB, but anything new was going onto SQL Server. Anyone wanting to build a new system will choose SQL Server, Postgres or one of the NoSQL databases. The cost savings are massive.\n\nAnd most places I know that are going cloud are going for Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure. These are well-established, do the job.\n\nSo what exactly is Oracle's cloud revenue? Forget that they mention AI. Yes, some of it will be AI. But how much is AI? How much is companies thinking \"yeah, we'll put all our growing business on Oracle\" and how much is it just companies that run a load of old Oracle and migrating it from servers in their basement to Oracle's cloud?\n\nI have to add, I'd also like to know these answers for all the clouds.\n\nIt's an important question, because if it's mostly migration, then the growth is not going to keep going. It's going to be a big shift for a short time and then go back to small growth after everyone has migrated.\n\nI wouldn't touch Oracle without getting those answers.",

They are very rare, and work fundamentally different compared to other high volume companies.\n\n\nThis lack of orders was very much to be expected. Intel and samsung are a bit in trouble and need restructuring, TSMC us a dominant force and is mildly expanding, China is now banned for most of their product line.\n\n\nBut even with all those bad markers, the net income was good. The outlooks are good. Yes there are some (minor) risks, like low competition on the semiconductor market and bad AI expectation, but these risks do not offset the fact that there is no real alternative for 70% of their products.\n\n\nSo yeah. ASML is fine. Inconsider 630 am absolute steal.",

At 400 million shares outstanding (actually 403 from the year end), that would give you around 160B market cap at that point. 2022 net income was around 5.625B. 160/5.625 = 28.44 PE.

The screener is quite unique - we are giving fundamentals, insider, and institutional score to all tickets, in the screener you can give weights to each search that way.\u00a0\n\nAnyone can see 10 year of ttm data for all tickers, without needing to signup!\n\nI created posts in value investing subreddit about acls, nssc, bsy, knsl, afya, pgny. I found all these from the screener. Some other finds I had this year and has been very good for me although at this point can\u2019t say undervalued with enough safety margin as they raced up; iesc, strl, anet, pcty, ax, tgls, race.\n\nFeedback appreciated!\u00a0\n\nPs: I\u2019m a data scientist working a 9-5 job. Me and my friend (both market enthusiasts) originally made the tool to help ourselves make better investment decisions.

It operates the eponymous cable channel and various other PPV channels and streaming platforms (amc+ and others).\n\nMarket Cap: $383.21 million  \nTotal Cash: $802.55 million\u202f  \nTotal Debt: $2.49 billion  \nEnterprise Value (EV): $2,070.66 billion\n\nOCF: $\u202a\u202a424.72\u202fmillion  \nFCF: $395.00\u202fmillion  \nNet income (TTM): \u202a\u202a$58.18 million  \nEBITDA: $1.44 billion\n\nDebt decreased slightly over the last four years, the company pays no dividends.\n\nHistorical net income data:  \n2020: $239.98\u202fmillion  \n2021: $250.60\u202fmillion  \n2022: $7.59\u202fmillion (dent caused by one time restructuring charge)  \n2023: $215.46 million\n\nNominal PE (Market Cap/TTM NI) is 6.6x  \nEV/TTM EBITDA is 2070,66/1440 = 1,44x\n\nShareholders equity is \u202a\u202a$1.05 billion so P/B (Market Cap/Shareholders equity) is 383,21/1050 = 0,36x\n\nCashflow from operating activities has steadily recovered after a drop from 2020 to 2021 (-80.84%) and has doubled TTM ($203.58 in 2023 to $424.72 million TTM). ROE is 5.54% which is low and stems from a low net profit margin of 2.3%.\n\nRisks:\n\n\\*ROE of 5.54% is constrained by high interest expenses because of substantial debt ($2.49 billion) and unusual items (the industry\u2019s average is significantly lower, but competitors like Netflix come in at \\~31%)  \n\\* net profit margin at 2.3% due to non-operating costs  \n\\* the degrowth hypothesis seems more likely at the moment, as revenue forecasts show a declining revenue  \n\\* general sentiment is negative and might drive the price further down, as its short interest already sits at \\~24%\n\nSummary:  \nlow valuation at 6.6x P/E; good FCF; low P/B ratio of 0.36x; profitable; mixed financial strength situation\n\nCatalysts:  \ndebt isn\u2019t increasing but stagnating and the recent rate cut from the Federal Reserve can improve cashflow and debt management (D/E ratio of 2.37); there is still an ongoing transition from cable to streaming from which AMC might profit; AMC and Netflix closed streaming deal in July 2024; the worst case scenario seems to be priced in already;",

A long time ago a stock like AMCX would be acquired for its library, so I guess that potential exists except this company is controlled by a family and it will not be sold until they decide to sell. I owned it for a couple of years but missed the one opportunity to sell at a profit (when it was confused with AMC theaters and popped to $80 during the meme stock heyday). Good luck, however.",

But other countries are still seriously funding chips/fabs, EU has over $48B in funding for new fabs, Japan $13B, S Korea $19B, Germany $20B, etc. I also expect some of this is increase especially if China ends up making their own EUV machines and fabs, also note Chinas funding in 2024 was $45B, so around 30% of the government funding from the main countries which is definitely significant but there are also businesses adding their own funding too.",

        "post_body": "I'd love to hear your thoughts. Here is my analysis of why Nucor, America's largest steel manufacturer is a buy at these prices.\n\nThe steel industry as a whole in the USA makes up a tiny percentage of all steel manufacturing in the world, and steel stocks in general trade at a significant discount to the market as a whole. But I believe out of the major American steel companies, Nucor is the best poised to be a good investment.\n\nFor starters, they have had positive free cash flow for 10/10 of the past years, totaling roughly $38 billion in total FCF brought in. This is larger than their current market cap. On top of that, they only have about $7 billion of *total* debt, while having $5.4 billion of cash and equivalents. They could easily have paid off their total debt just from 2023's FCF, or from their cash balance + 2 of their *worst* years of free cash flows.\n\nAlso, compare Nucor's ROIC metrics to a competitor such as say, U.S. Steel. The [former](https://quickfs.net/company/NUE:US) has maintained a positive and mostly strong ROIC since 2000, with just a small dip into negative territory in 2009. [U.S. Steel](https://quickfs.net/company/X:US), on the other hand, has fluctuated consistently between positive and negative ROIC, while also having negative FCF in 5 of their last 10 years. It is clear which company has been a more consistent earner.\n\nA similar comparison can be made with Cleveland Cliffs and Metallus, although Steel Dynamics has a similarly consistent record as a company (but nowhere near the same size/scope of reach).\n\nAs a cherry on top, Nucor is a dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend for the past 50+ years. They also have and continue to plan to buy back shares, which will increase the return for shareholders. Shares outstanding have dropped from 314 million in 2009 to 240 million in 2024, approximately a 24% decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, despite steel being a historically cyclical business dependent on steel prices, I believe Nucor has proven itself to be a strong and resilient player in the US market. As long as they consistently return capital to shareholders, they are a strong buy at today's market cap of $36.5 billion.\n\nLet me know if and why you agree or disagree in the comments!",

                "comment_body": "There\u2019s some really important stuff missing from your consideration of the steel business and an important reason Nucor has been consistently profitable. \n  \nNucor arose as a disruptor because they had electric arc furnaces. EAFs melt scrap steel and turn it into good steel by electrocuting the shit out of it. \n  \nThis is very different than traditional steel which is done by burning the shit out of some iron ore with metallurgical coal. This requires larger capex per plant, but can get to very low cost when scale is large. \n  \nThe margin profiles of the two businesses are totally different. EAF steel plants depend on the spread between scrap and hot rolled steel. Blast furnace depends on the spread between iron ore + coal and hot rolled steel. \n  \nThere are different types of steels and specialty steels, some of which are only doable with blast furnace type plants.  \n  \nNucor and Steel dynamics are both EAF, which is why their profile is similar. Cleveland cliff and Us steel are traditional blast furnace but CLF has some EAF too. US Steel needs to invest more to modernize plants and build some EAF capacity but they don\u2019t have the money. This is why Nippon was coming in to make a bid, but it\u2019s been contentious because CLF and US Steel are in very politically important areas.  \n  \nI favor Steel Dynamics because their plants are newer and the founder is still the CEO and I generally favor founder CEOs when I can get them. \n  \nYou also need to understand the geopolitics of steel which is quite complex. Chinese steel companies overbuilt capacity and were running negative profit margins. This started to change in the mid 2010s when the government forced consolidation of the industry and prices started to turn around for steel. Then the U.S. adopted tariffs on steel which helped US steelmakers. Now the infrastructure bill and IRA include subsidies for U.S. made steel so I think the industry is well protected for US steel makers and margins going forward should be better than historical.",

                "comment_body": "I\u2019ve been working on Nucor too, as you can tell from my post history \n\nMy thesis is that Nucor is an excellent company with a good capital allocation record that has seen a temporary setback in a drop in steel prices, and thus sales, but one that will inevitably revert due to the cyclical nature of the industry.\n\nNucor\u2019s valuation is pretty attractive and their free cash flow is good as well. They have a policy to pay out 40% of net earnings, either in dividends or buybacks. I figured this was very attractive, until I realised free cash is free cash. If they make a good return and somehow use it in the business, to pay off debt, to make buybacks or to pay out dividends, it doesn\u2019t matter - as long as they make the return.\n\nNucor is the dominant US firm with only Steel Dynamics in a near comparison, but they are a smaller company too, which could be a reason for their greater efficiency. \n\nHeres some other stuff though:\nFirst, I struggle to call Nucor a low cost producer. They are the low cost producer among US firms, but the nature of steel is that it\u2019s a commodity and the import/export market is very active. Chinese steel could be imported at cheaper overall prices into the US in some cases, and customers have no incentive to stick with Nucor, despite maybe maintaining a relationship with them - not a strong barrier. In fact, Cleveland Cliffs recently said that Chinese steel is being imported through Mexico to avoid tariffs. There are measures in place to protect domestic steel companies, but if things like this happen\u2026 \n\nSecond, steel prices may have greater to drop. I think the concept of mean reversion is probably what underlies cyclically in the first place. The only companies that can beat mean reversion are the ones that have a moat - they can earn high returns on capital consistently without external factors pulling them down. Nucor, clearly, does not have that sort of dynamic. They may have a claim in being the lowest cost producer, which I already am not sure of, but we know their returns vary and change in cycles. I would argue that the good returns of these last 3 years, is setting mean reversion up, and returns will drop over the next few years, before then picking up again eventually at some point (though I have no clue when). If you look at steel prices, they are not at pre-pandemic levels (maybe still at a 50% premium to those levels) so it could drop further - steel prices have to revert to the mean too. I was hoping interest rates dropping would rejuvenate demand but I doubt we will see the effects until late 2025, and then only when the improvement in demand translates to sales will we see an improvement in stock prices. It\u2019s not a short term play because of this\n\nI\u2019m at the point now where I still feel Nucor could be a good investment, but with a 10 year timeframe. It\u2019s a good company that will do well, and probably still be dominant. Simply because of mean reversion, I am thinking results will suffer a little the next year or two, before the cycle hopefully turns. Which is why I don\u2019t even want to think about the short term, and just want to hold it till the next peak of the cycle.\n\nThe long term danger to Nucor could well be Steel Dynamics to be honest. They have beaten Nucor in ROCE on average the past 10yrs. I don\u2019t know enough about the company to determine if that is an actual issue or not, but their returns make me wonder. They run electric arc furnaces too, seem to be a lot like Nucor since they originated from Nucor, and are doing well. Nucor\u2019s CEO changed in 2020, and then quickly benefited from the boom in 2021 and 2022, so it\u2019s hard to assess their ability objectively. If they misstep, Steel Dynamics could take advantage. Something to look at before investing - is the dominant position in the US market defensible over the next 10yrs?\n\nWhere I am now: Decided to take a break from the analysis because I realised I was entering a market timing state of mind, trying to figure out when steel prices will bottom out or not - a waste of time that I did not want to let myself do. So I decided to step away\n\nwhenever I go back, i\u2019ll be studying US Steel, Cleveland Cliffs, and Steel Dynamics. But the US steel market is not limited only to US firms, so I will look at POSCO, ArcelorMittal, and maybe some Chinese firms if I can. It would not be a proper analysis without these.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add on with something I read a few minutes ago: In the Fundsmith Owner\u2019s Manual, there is a short discussion on cyclicals, saying that there is an adage to buy when they look expensive, because they are at the bottom of their cycle when they have little or no earnings that will go up as the cycle progresses, and sell when they are cheap, as they have high earnings that will go down as the cycle progresses. Unintuitive but logical. In the manual, though, it is discussed in the context that such cyclicals require market timing and Fundsmith does not want to try timing the market. Wise advice indeed",

The Europeans have also done similarly, and there is some interesting tech in SSAB in Sweden for example. \n\nI think Asian steel will struggle because of China\u2019s massive overcapacity and the Chinese firms disregard for making profits.",

The company noted that demand may moderate in the second half of 2024 due to the macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending patterns. This uncertainty in demand could lead to fluctuating revenues and affect the overall financial stability of the company.\n\nThe demand for image sensors remains healthy in China but is relatively tepid in the rest of the world due to cautious consumer spending.\n\nAxcelis is investing significantly in the Advanced Logic market, which is still in the nascent stage. This multi-year effort is unlikely to yield immediate returns, and there is inherent risk in the company's strategy to gain market share in this underpenetrated area. Long cycles and uncertain adoption rates could delay financial benefits.\n\n*ACLS Issues Underwhelming Guidance*\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, ACLS estimates revenues of approximately $255 million, which suggests a 12.7% decline from the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be $1.43, which represents a 28.1% decline from prior year actuals.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be slightly above the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $260.6 million, suggesting a decline of 16.1% year over year.",

Kinda like See's Candy did for Berkshire. They tried to expand it, but it didnt take off.  But usually high ROCE + reinvesting into business means higher growth and stock price appreciation.  \nAlso price to book ratio? Does it even matter in today's world? Some assets are off the books.",

        "post_body": "**Investment Report**\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Palladium and Platinum Supply Risks:**\u00a0Both metals face significant supply risks, with production heavily concentrated in Russia and South Africa. Geopolitical tensions, operational disruptions, and shrinking reserves could tighten the market and drive prices higher.\n* **Delayed EV Transition:**\u00a0The anticipated rapid shift to electric vehicles (EVs) has been slower than expected, with internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid vehicles still dominating. This supports continued demand for palladium and platinum in catalytic converters.\n* **Potential Short Squeeze in Palladium:**\u00a0Short interest in palladium has dropped by nearly half since its peak, contributing to a 30% price rise. If supply disruptions or stronger demand emerge, a short squeeze could send prices soaring.\n* **Investment Opportunities:**\u00a0Investors can capitalize on these dynamics through ETFs, long-term physical holdings, or selectively investing in mining stocks. With structural supply deficits and potential price recovery, palladium and platinum present compelling opportunities.\n\n\u00a0If you want to see the whole theis with the graphs and price images go to my substack:  \n[https://smallcaptreasures.substack.com/p/palladium-and-platinum-the-dawn-of?r=1od1d5](https://smallcaptreasures.substack.com/p/palladium-and-platinum-the-dawn-of?r=1od1d5)  \n\n\n# 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction:\n\nPalladium, part of the platinum group metals (PGMs), is a crucial element, primarily used in catalytic converters for vehicles. These converters play a vital role in reducing harmful emissions, helping the automotive industry meet strict environmental standards. In recent years, however, the palladium market has suffered a significant decline, largely driven by expectations of future surpluses. Since its peak in 2022, palladium prices have plummeted as investors bet on an oversupplied market.\n\nIn my view, the market is overreacting. The short thesis surrounding palladium, which we\u2019ll dive into later, is starting to unravel, and some savvy investors are beginning to take notice. I believe this is just the beginning. The overwhelming evidence points to strong upside potential for palladium and other PGMs, and soon, the market will have no choice but to respond.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore palladium\u2019s market structure, key suppliers, the dynamics behind short interest, the implications of the electric vehicle (EV) transition, and strategic investment opportunities. We\u2019ll also examine the recycling market and the current state of above-ground stocks.\n\n# 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Key suppliers and global supply chain risks:\n\nPalladium and platinum production is heavily concentrated in Russia and South Africa. Russia, particularly through Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel), is the largest producer of palladium, while South Africa dominates in platinum production. Together, these two countries account for the majority of global supply, making any disruptions in their mining sectors critical for market stability.\n\n**Russia**\n\nRussia's palladium supply is heavily influenced by geopolitical factors, and the situation is precarious. Russian mining operations rely on high-tech equipment from the US and Europe, which makes them vulnerable to any potential embargo on these essential components. A full technology embargo could seriously cripple Russian palladium production.\n\nWhile Nornickel remains profitable, this is largely due to government subsidies, which keep the operation afloat. Interestingly, palladium and platinum exports from Russia have so far avoided major tariffs, as these metals are vital to the automotive sectors in both the US and Europe. However, given the deteriorating relationship between Russia and the West, the imposition of tariffs cannot be ruled out in the future.\n\nHaving half of the world\u2019s palladium production concentrated in Russia also makes the global supply highly vulnerable to black swan events\u2014be it a natural disaster like a flood or tornado, or unforeseen geopolitical disruptions.\n\nIn addition, Russia appears to be using palladium sales to finance its ongoing war efforts. Recent evidence of Russia\u2019s central bank purchasing large quantities of precious metals, including palladium and platinum, suggests that the country may have already depleted a significant portion of its reserves to fund the war.\n\n**South Africa**\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s mining sector faces its own challenges, including frequent power outages, labor strikes, and corruption. These issues have led to production cuts, adding strain to the global supply of PGMs. Producers such as Anglo American Platinum and Sibanye Stillwater have already scaled back their expansion projects, and there are fears that further operational setbacks could exacerbate supply shortages.\n\nSibanye Stillwater, one of the leading platinum producers, has faced significant operational disruptions, including regulatory fines and large-scale layoffs. Another major producer, Impala Platinum, is also nearing the end of its primary mining life, with its largest mine set to close in 2031.\n\nMost miners are operating at a loss and if we do not see some upside on palladium and platinum prices supply will continue to suffer.\n\n**Recycling**\n\nMuch of the market's expectations for palladium supply growth is based on recycling. As diesel vehicles, which use palladium in their catalytic converters, reach the end of their life cycle, palladium recycling is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9%. However, any delays in this trend materializing could lead to a significant price surge.\n\nSeveral factors are already pushing this timeline back. Higher interest rates, combined with the rise of remote work, are encouraging people to hold on to their old vehicles longer than expected. Additionally, around 10% of palladium recycling is suspected to be conducted by illegal operations, which are now under increased scrutiny by the FBI. Several US states have implemented strict regulations to combat this criminal activity, but these laws are so stringent that they may inadvertently reduce legal recycling efforts as well.\n\n# 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Short interest and the potential for a short squeeze:\n\nShort interest in palladium peaked on August 6th, with traders betting on a surplus in supply and falling demand. However, short positions have nearly halved since that peak, leading to a 30% rise in palladium prices as traders rushed to close their positions. If supply disruptions from Russia or South Africa materialize, or if demand for palladium strengthens, there could be a substantial short squeeze, driving prices significantly higher.\n\nWall Street's primary concern is the rise in recycled palladium. Recycling palladium is not highly profitable unless prices are elevated, and mining remains a challenging business at current prices. As palladium prices rise, however, the incentive to recycle grows, potentially putting downward pressure on prices in the future. For now, the market appears to be bouncing back into a bullish trend.\n\n# 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ICE to EV transition: a slower reality:\n\nThe narrative surrounding the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has been a key factor in the recent decline in palladium prices. Since EVs do not require palladium for catalytic converters, investors had forecasted a shift away from PGMs. However, recent data suggest that this transition may not happen as quickly as expected.\n\nIn developing countries, the adoption of EVs is slower due to infrastructural challenges, while in the US and Europe, recent surveys and sales data suggest that consumers still prefer gasoline or hybrid vehicles. A\u00a0**Deloitte**\u00a0survey found that 88% of US car buyers prefer fossil fuel-powered or hybrid vehicles, which still require palladium and platinum in catalytic converters.\n\nMoreover, recent data indicates that sales of EVs have slowed considerably. In the first half of 2024,\u00a0**Volkswagen**'s EV sales in the US were down 28%, while\u00a0**Volvo**'s sales fell 72%. Even companies like\u00a0**Ford**, which saw a rise in EV sales, reported significant losses of $2.5 billion on their EV division. Similarly, in Europe, EV sales fell 44.3% in August 2024. This suggests that internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid vehicles will continue to dominate the market for longer than expected, supporting demand for palladium and platinum.\n\n# 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Palladium surpluses into the future:\n\nBoth palladium and platinum have seen significant price declines in recent years. Since their respective peaks, palladium has dropped by 66%, while platinum has fallen by 25%. These declines are largely due to negative sentiment surrounding the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). However, as noted earlier, the shift to EVs may not happen as quickly as expected, and demand for palladium and platinum in catalytic converters remains strong.\n\nThe forecasted structural deficits in palladium and platinum supply further support the potential for a price recovery. Palladium production has already decreased by 10% since its peak in 2019, and many producers are struggling to remain profitable at current price levels. If prices do not rebound soon, the industry risks seeing bankruptcies, which would further reduce supply and set the stage for a bull market.\n\nThe market had initially expected a surplus in platinum until 2026, but this outlook is now shifting. We could see supply deficits well into 2027, and with above-ground reserves covering less than six months of demand, the situation is tightening. Additionally, investors are beginning to see palladium and platinum as valuable resources, which could drive prices higher. Sibanye Stillwater has projected market deficits until 2030, and while their outlook may be somewhat biased, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that we are unlikely to see surpluses in the palladium market anytime soon.\n\n# 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investment strategies:\n\nInvestors looking to capitalize on the current dynamics in the palladium and platinum markets may want to explore the following strategies:\n\n1. **ETFs**: Investing in physical palladium or platinum ETFs offers a relatively low-risk way to gain exposure to these metals as supply deficits grow. These funds allow investors to participate in the price appreciation of the metals without the operational risks that come with mining companies. Personally, I would consider SPPP, as it provides a balanced 50/50 exposure to both palladium and platinum, making it a solid choice for those wanting to hedge their bets on both metals.\n2. **Mining Stocks**: Companies such as Sibanye Stillwater and Anglo American Platinum offer leveraged exposure to rising palladium and platinum prices. However, these stocks come with greater risks, especially given the operational challenges in Russia and South Africa. At the moment, I would avoid these companies, particularly since Anglo American is rumored to be considering divesting its stake in Anglo American Platinum, and Sibanye Stillwater faces significant risks beyond just palladium price recovery.\n3. **Long-Term Physical Holdings**: For investors with a longer-term horizon, holding physical platinum or palladium could be a strategic play. As supply deficits widen and prices begin to rebound, physical holdings could provide strong returns, especially in a market facing structural shortages.\n\n# 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion:\n\nPalladium and platinum markets are at a turning point. While recent years have been clouded by concerns over the rise of electric vehicles and an increase in recycling, the reality on the ground is starting to tell a different story. The shift to electric vehicles isn\u2019t happening as quickly as many predicted, and traditional internal combustion and hybrid vehicles\u2014both of which still need palladium and platinum\u2014are sticking around longer than expected.\n\nOn top of that, supply risks from key producers like Russia and South Africa are real, and we\u2019re already seeing production cuts. With reserves shrinking and geopolitical tensions rising, the supply-demand balance could tighten, leading to a rebound in prices.\n\nFor investors, this could be a great opportunity. Whether through ETFs, physical holdings, or carefully selected mining stocks, the potential for upside is growing. As the market starts to wake up to these realities, those who move early could benefit from what may be a strong rally in palladium and platinum. The facts are stacking up in favor of these metals, and it\u2019s worth considering how to position yourself to take advantage of it.",

The supply risks from Russia and South Africa are definitely concerning, especially with the geopolitical tensions and operational issues. The slower EV transition is an interesting point - I've seen similar data showing ICE and hybrid vehicles sticking around longer than expected. That should help support demand for these metals in catalytic converters.\n\nThe potential for a short squeeze in palladium is intriguing. With short interest dropping and prices already up 30%, further supply disruptions or demand increases could really send it soaring. \n\nFor investment strategies, I agree ETFs are probably the safest play here. Physical holdings could work well for patient investors too. I'd be more cautious on the mining stocks given the operational risks you mentioned.\n\nOverall, it seems like the market may be underestimating the upside potential for palladium and platinum. The supply deficits and slower-than-expected EV transition create an interesting setup. Definitely worth keeping an eye on as the situation develops.",

I\u2019ve been using Finviz with presets I\u2019ve collected from YouTube and forums, focusing on growth, shorts, breakouts, etc. I run these screeners and analyze stocks using technical indicators, news, fundamentals, etc.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. After running the screener, what should I be looking for? I check for trends, resistance, etc. Any tips?\n2. How can I screen for stocks that gap regularly? Haven\u2019t tried that setting yet in Finviz.\n3. Is there a way to use the screener to see daily open/close trends for better analysis?\n4. Can a screener show pre-market trading data?\n\nThanks!",

I want something that just tanked hard, or is tanking hard over a few days. An example is CRWD. Dropped from 380 to like 250. ASML just tanked, and today was a $17 rebound. NVDA did a run up to 130ish and then tanked to 97 in August, and now hitting about 140. I'll buy stock or do option calls/leaps. To me it is kind of the same thing.",

CCJ has already baked it into the cake.\n\nWhy hasn't it grown or priced it in yet? Because it's not big enough. You can't fit a train through a drain pipe. Because of that the volatility on CCJ is huge as institutions try to buy it. They can't find enough sellers so they can't buy it.

Severely beaten up from a variety of factors but there is a solid chance there is a path back to $60-$80. It\u2019s a very old profitable company. I think I will play this one. Pe is way under sector 12 ish and sector is 21. It has crashed three times before and recovered all three times. \n\nTLDR on crash..Hurricane destroyed their IV factory. They supply 60% of IV fluids worldwide..chip shortage messed up their pump buisness (behind them)..they paid too much for hil rom before interest rate hike which hit them hard. Overall good company. Just bad circumstances that seem to be priced in. \n\nIf their factory doesn\u2019t come online as they say it will get uglier. But good price for a starter position imo. \n\nWrite up does a great job..but very bullish writer. He sees a double in 3 years. But idk even if it falls short it has plenty of nice upside here. \n\nGo ahead..tear me apart..again \n\n* I will say I have worked a lot of hospitals and I have never used one of their pumps. They are almost all alaris. ",

        "post_body": "Tredegar (TG) received some favorable news today as Brazilian regulators approved the sale of the Terphane business to Oben Group. This sale will close November 1 and the company expects to clear $85M from the sale. I expect TG to use proceeds to reduce debt. \n\nTG is a small cap industrial with a current market cap of $275M at a $7.99 share price. After the sale, it will have two divisions, one doing Aluminum extrusion and the other selling PE films. Both divisions are profitable and EBITDA positive. \n\nTG is currently selling at a discount to normal valuations as 2023 was awful for them as all three businesses slowed due to excess inventories.  They lost $3.10/share last year and EBITDA dropped to $53M. They had to work with banks to renegotiate covenants with their banks and credit debt at the end of 2023 peaked at 3.9x EBITDA. They eliminated their dividend and the share price hit a 52 week low of $3.98. \n\nAll three businesses have rebounded in 2024 and they were profitable with $0.26/share profitability in Q2 with EBITDA of $26M. They reduced credit debt to 2.5x at the end of the quarter.  With the sale of the Terphane business used for debt reduction, I expect credit debt to reduce to 0.8x by the end of 2024. \n\nNo analysts cover TG. With the remaining divisions, I see sales next year at $672M achieving EBITDA of $80M and earnings of $1.22/share.  FCF should be about $36M assuming CAPEX of $20M. With debt at manageable levels, I expect them to resume a dividend, likely less than the $0.13/share they had when it was suspended.  With continued profitability, I expect the market to revalue TG to a historical level in the mid teen share price range with a 12x PE. That would represent a 75-100% upside from today\u2019s closing share price. \n\nThis is my take on TG. Please do your own due diligence before considering a position in TG. ",

Which due to the product nature when bouught on margin I cannot sell for 1 month.\n\nThe rationale is what if both go up? This gives me the best spread in that scenario.\n\nIf both go down then i sell at $55 on CCJ removing the margin\n\nIf one goes down then i can assess if CCJ is worth riding on more covered calls.",

Lately, most of those users (Microsoft/Amazon etc) are focusing on reliability of electricity supply, something that renewable energy alone cannot provide, forcing them to be dependent on other fossil fuel sources, particularely nuclear power. Currently, most analysts predict around 1.5tn USD investments in new nuclear capacity investments by 2050, with Uranium prices soaring globally.\n\nThe US produce around 80k pounds/year vs a total demand of 40m pounds/year, with some plants such as Three Mile Island reopening and able to provide carbon free nuclear power to Microsoft, with potentially other AI companies following soon.\n\nEncore Energy (US) is a US based uranium producer, advancing few projects across Texas and New Mexico, including In-Situ recovering technology (similar to what OKLO is doing). Encore recently ramped up its Alta Mira plant, able to produce 1.5m pounds/year of Uranium for the US market.\n\nShares currently trading around 4.20 USD, I am in with 40k shares at 4.05 USD, on top of having huge growth potential, this can benefit from the recent hype in Uranium.\n\nWhat do you think?",

This is a highly cyclical business closely tied to the housing market.\n\nNow to be fair, this company is much different than the one from 2021. They have taken on a substantial amount of debt. They have done this to repurchase shares and aggressively expand. They just opened a massive location in Newport beach, they are opening in NC, and beginning an international expansion. They are also starting to operate in the hospitality space. I think RH is a dominant brand and Gary Friedman is ballsy enough and a visionary. This is more in line with my thesis. I will most likely post a deeper dive when I get some free time.",

This is a far cry from the crazy valuations this business was bought at in the past. This is a company that has been growing revenue and EPS at an impressive mark into the present. It is also a company who is closely tied to interest rates as people finance or lease their vehicles. This has worked against some of their financial results, but they have proven far more resilient than other car businesses. \n\nI am investing in the  future outlook for TSLA.

Minimum investment:\n   - Mutual funds: Often have minimum investment requirements.\n   - ETFs: Can be purchased for the price of a single share.\n\n3. Management:\n   - Mutual funds: More often actively managed, though passive index funds exist.\n   - ETFs: Typically passively managed, tracking an index, though active ETFs are growing.\n\n4. Fees:\n   - Mutual funds: Generally have higher expense ratios.\n   - ETFs: Usually have lower expense ratios.\n\n5. Tax efficiency:\n   - Mutual funds: Can create taxable events when selling holdings.\n   - ETFs: Generally more tax-efficient due to their structure.\n\n6. Transparency:\n   - Mutual funds: Disclose holdings quarterly.\n   - ETFs: Most disclose holdings daily.\n\n7. Accessibility:\n   - Mutual funds: Purchased directly from fund companies or through brokers.\n   - ETFs: Bought and sold through brokerage accounts like stocks.",

        "post_date": "2024-10-16T14:54:18",
        "post_body": "In an era where technology is rapidly transforming the landscape of business communication, 1606 Corp (CBDW) stands out for its innovative approach to investor relations (IR) and customer engagement through the use of cutting-edge chatbot technology. Their advanced system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and predictive analytics, setting a new standard for how companies interact with stakeholders.\n\n  \n**Natural Language Processing: Understanding Users Conversationally**\n\nAt the core of 1606 Corp\u2019s chatbot technology is natural language processing, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand and interpret human language in a conversational manner. This capability allows the chatbot to engage with users in a way that feels intuitive and responsive. When investors or customers pose queries, the chatbot can analyze the language, discern intent, and provide relevant answers without requiring users to navigate through complex menus or predefined scripts.\n\nThis conversational interface not only enhances user experience but also fosters a more personalized interaction. By understanding the nuances of language, the chatbot can respond in a way that aligns with the user\u2019s expectations, making it easier for them to find the information they need.\n\n  \n**Predictive Analytics: Anticipating Needs**  \nBeyond immediate responses, 1606 Corp employs predictive analytics to anticipate the needs of both investors and customers. By analyzing historical data and trends, the system can identify patterns in user behavior and preferences. For instance, if an investor frequently inquires about financial reports or market trends, the chatbot can proactively present relevant information or alerts, streamlining the communication process.\n\nThis anticipatory capability is especially beneficial in investor relations, where timely and relevant information can significantly influence investment decisions. By providing insights before users even ask, 1606 Corp enhances its value proposition, ensuring that stakeholders feel informed and engaged.\n\n\n\n**Machine Learning: Continuous Improvement**\n\nThe effectiveness of 1606 Corp\u2019s chatbot is further augmented by machine learning algorithms that enable the system to learn from each interaction. As users engage with the chatbot, it gathers data on user queries and preferences, continuously refining its responses and recommendations over time. This iterative learning process means that the chatbot becomes increasingly sophisticated in understanding context, nuance, and user intent.\n\nAs the technology evolves, the chatbot not only improves its accuracy but also enhances its ability to handle more complex inquiries. This ongoing improvement ensures that 1606 Corp remains responsive to the changing needs of its investors and customers, ultimately driving better engagement and satisfaction.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n1606 Corp (CBDW) is at the forefront of integrating AI technology into investor relations and customer service through its innovative chatbot platform. By harnessing natural language processing, predictive analytics, and machine learning, the company not only enhances user interaction but also anticipates the needs of its stakeholders. As the landscape of business communication continues to evolve, 1606 Corp is well-positioned to leverage these advancements, ensuring it meets and exceeds the expectations of its investors and customers alike.\n\n[https://cbdw.ai/1606-corp-cbdw-revolutionizing-investor-relations-with-ai-powered-chatbot-technology/](https://cbdw.ai/1606-corp-cbdw-revolutionizing-investor-relations-with-ai-powered-chatbot-technology/)",

        "post_body": "Hey guys,\n\nRecently I have taken an interest and stake in both Hammond Power Solution and Hammond Manufacturing. They are both Canadian companies, the former does dry core transformers, the latter manufacturers electrical boxes and other balance of system components. I think they are great companies in general, partly because it's family run. Unfortunately Canadian companies don't enjoy the same kind of scrutiny as American ones. But anyways - what I want to ask you about is something that didn't really set well with me. Here is the news article of selling the shares:\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/27/2954522/0/en/Hammond-Power-Solutions-Closes-65-5-Million-Bought-Deal-Secondary-Offering.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/27/2954522/0/en/Hammond-Power-Solutions-Closes-65-5-Million-Bought-Deal-Secondary-Offering.html)\n\nFour days earlier they raised the price target:  \n[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/tse-hps.a-boost-price-target-2024-09-24/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/tse-hps.a-boost-price-target-2024-09-24/)\n\nBasically, if I understand this correctly, William Hammond (board chair) sold shares directly to an institutional investor, namely Accumen Capital. He sold it for about 10% less market value at the time, and the share price has slowly recovered since.\n\nWhat caused concern to me is Accumen Capital raised their price target to 165 only a few days before buying these shares. So they raise the share price during the same time they bought 65M worth of shares at a substantially reduced price. Isn't that ...unethical?",

I'm not sure I can't do better than this, and open to ideas\n\n**868 Xinyi Glass** - Glass manufacturer with very nice financials. They make automobile glass, glass for construction, solar panels (through their subsidiary Xinyi Solar), and smart glass. They have been pummelled by the negative trends in both automobiles and clean energy. Tariffs risk also high. Their current level of earnings are perfectly acceptable and they pay good dividends, but the earnings can go both ways and the stock is very volatile. However there is good compensation on the price\n\n**1093 CSPC Pharma** - Good healthcare company IMO and one of the more transparent companies on the market. They have a very active pipeline and are progressing new drugs along the route to market all the time. Excellent financials, and growth potential. Recently signalled buybacks. Dividend pretty good. Not the cheapest but I think it's worth it\n\n**3658 New Hope Services** - Property management company being fed new properties by their parent New Hope Group as well as growing organically on the market. Financials superb. Dividends great. The barriers to entry for competition are also higher than they used to be as this market has been regulated recently. I think this is an overlooked small cap.\n\nIn general I am staying away from the biggest names because I don't perceive as much value there. However I think there is plenty in the mid and small cap markets. And I only have fairly modest exposure to China. Even if everything goes to zero I could live with it. I see China as a good way to diversify exposure because it is very uncorrelated with US/Europe",

And in my personal opinion, yes it is. And I can handle all scenarios. And, I think this is a good diversifier of risk and can counterintuitively reduce risk at the overall portfolio level. I could say that US market also comes with high risk because multiples are very high, and any unwinding of optimism will have a ruinous and sustained effect on prices - that is a risk, but a different risk.\n\nAll of the companies I mentioned are audited by big four. I think this 'they're all cooking the numbers' thing is a lazy, ignorant, knee-jerk. Definitely risks around governance. The market as a whole tends to be opaque. And yeah maybe the CCP will kick us out and keep our money. They have never said they aren't real Marxist communists. But again, is it worth the risk at the price?\n\nAnd look, it must also be said that of all the markets in the world, China has the best potential for future growth. They are in a sweet spot of economic development for investment. They have by far the world's largest potential market. Not so long ago, investors were all over it for these reasons, and their companies used to trade at far higher multiples. Well the market 'got it wrong' then and now they are at much lower multiples.

And it has very attractive margins for a manufacturer.

It's great value too IMO. But I don't want to buy at the top, and I really don't like the momentum of it over the past 5 years. I know value investing is about fundamentals, not momentum, but if I buy into it I'd probably only expect dividend gains from it long-term.",

When share price appreciates, I often swap issues for cap gains and higher yield.  \n\nWhen the bond market gets spooked and preferred prices are dropping, I sometimes short higher price/lower yield issues in as much a ratio of 1/4 to 1/2 the amount of long shares that I own and I'll swap on that side as well. This reduces the volatility as well as the losses.\n\nI've been doing this for nearly 25 years.  Last year, the total return for this preferred stock income portfolio was 18%.  It was -1% for the previous year because interest rates were rising (yielding about 6.50% then). If rates continue to fall, there will be additional cap gains. \n\nIMHO, people looking for consistent yield and some decent growth potential should be learning about this sector.\n\nTim McPartland has a good web site for preferred stock info. Lots of really knowledgeable contributors with no agenda.\n\nAnd for noobs, here a good intro read and it's free:\n\n[https://www.preferredstockinvesting.com/v5/pages/book\\_main.htm](https://www.preferredstockinvesting.com/v5/pages/book_main.htm)",

However, when I looked at the charts of some of the ADR stocks and ETFs, I realized they seem to have lower returns compared to the corresponding stocks listed on the respective Home-Country exchanges. To verify my hypothesis, I analyzed the returns of Infosys Ltd(NYSE: INFY) over the last 20 years. The underlying stock listed on NSE-India grew 914% over the last 20 years while the NYSE listed ADR grew only 534% after accounting for currency fluctuations. Below are the numbers. Am I missing something? \n\nIf my hypothesis is true, why do some of the mutual funds hold ADRs? Why don't they purchase the stocks directly from foreign exchanges? \n\n\n\n||Infy ADR on NYSE|Infosys stock on NSE-India|USD-INR conversion rate|Infy stock in USD|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Oct, 2004|$ 3.63|INR 105|1 USD = 45.61 INR|$ 2.302126727|\n|Current price|$ 23|INR 1960|1 USD = 84 INR|$ 23.33333333|\n|Total return|534%|1767%||914%|\n\n",

The fundamentals are solid, there\u2019s a supply-demand imbalance now and for the foreseeable future and it\u2019s price inelastic (nuclear reactors can\u2019t afford not to run regardless of fuel prices). Moreover, it\u2019s the best derivative play on AI imo. geopolitical factors are also increasingly conducive to increasing uranium prices (instability in africa, china stockpiling uranium and trying to buy out kazatomprom, kazakh supply being increasingly earmarked for china and russia, russia\u2019s dominance in fuel enrichment). moreover, the US is realizing it\u2019s been caught with its pants down (they buy enriched uranium from russia while sending weapons to ukraine - how does that make sense?) and are dedicating more resources to reshoring their nuclear fuel supply chain. For these reasons I\u2019m heavily invested in american and canadian uranium miners, developers along with small positions in some promising explorers. \n\nlots more discussion over at r/uraniumsqueeze - it\u2019s filled with people who actually believe the thesis. have to be careful since subs like that can be echo chambers at times but you\u2019ll find actual interesting conversation from people who\u2019ve done research rather than the usual responses you\u2019ll find here, where people usually scoff and say it\u2019s priced in.",

The thing is, due to long lead times on projects, an upper bound on future supply is also easy to forecast for the rest of the 2020s as any supply that\u2019d come online in this timeframe needs to have fundraising, permitting and development well under way. based on this upper bound (i.e. assuming all in-progress projects complete on time and produce the forecasted amounts, which is very unlikely given that the sector is riddled with delays and production forecast revisions), the supply deficit won\u2019t be addressed until at least the early 2030s. \n\nMoreover, some factors to consider:\n\n-china\u2019s been stockpiling uranium like crazy to secure energy autonomy and support their massive reactor buildout\n\n-western utilities have been contracting at very reduced rates recently, particularly this year. this means they\u2019ve been drawing down their inventories and will need to increase contracting sooner rather than later. despite lowered contracting volumes, uranium prices have kept steadily rising which is an incredibly bullish signal\n\n-financial/institutional players add additional secondary demand by buying up uranium on the free market. for instance, the sprott physical uranium trust holds 60Mlbs of uranium, continues to buy more, and its mandate obligates it to hold onto it indefinitely (i.e. they\u2019re not just stockpiling it to sell it for a nice buck when the price goes up)\n\nlet me know if this makes sense!",

        "post_body": "Berkshire Hathaway has long been known for its value investing mantra, but many of their purchases lately have been what we commonly refer to as growth stocks: [Nubank](https://capitalclimb.app/company/NU), [Snowflake](https://capitalclimb.app/company/SNOW), [Amazon](https://capitalclimb.app/company/SNOW). They\u2019re all far away from Warren\u2019s criteria of 'history of excellence.' Even the huge Apple stake raised many eyebrows when it was acquired.\n\nWhether these picks came from Warren Buffett himself, or from Ted and Todd\u2014or even Charlie Munger\u2019s BYD investment in 2008\u2014they seem, to me, to mean that even the ones who popularized value investing are \u2018rewriting\u2019 what value investing means in this new era of investing, where many tech companies delay profitability for scale.\n\nTwo questions regarding that:\n\n1. If Berkshire now has stakes in companies that do not check the usual Buffett list, but rather depend on a lot of future growth to be profitable, what do these companies (for the sake of understanding, growth stocks) have in common? Any of their growth picks\n2. If Buffett was to rewrite The Intelligent Investor today, what would change in the new book?",

Companies like Apple and Amazon aren't just growth stocks, they're dominant market leaders with strong competitive advantages - exactly what Buffett has always looked for.\n\nAs for what these picks have in common, they're all companies with huge moats and network effects. Nubank is disrupting banking in Latin America, Snowflake is becoming essential for data analytics, and Amazon... well, it's Amazon. They may not be profitable now, but they have clear paths to massive profits in the future.\n\nIf Buffett rewrote The Intelligent Investor today, he'd probably put more emphasis on intangible assets and network effects. The principles would stay the same - buy great businesses at fair prices - but the metrics for evaluating those businesses would change.\n\nFor anyone interested in learning more about growth investing strategies, check out r/growth_investing.

As a value stock investor, I focus on fundamentals:  free cash flow, balance sheet, history, etc.  I don't care what product the company makes.  How can I evaluate for \"tremendous growth potential\"?  I don't know what the value of a drug pipeline is, or whose chips are going to change the world, or who is secretly sitting on real estate that is about to jump in value.  I've worked in tech for forty five years at some of the biggest names in the industry, and I am no better at picking tech winners and losers than anyone else.   On the other hand, I looked at TJX years ago, noticed a strong balance sheet, constantly increasing same store sales, responsible debt management, and it has paid off in spades.  I have no moonshots in my portfolio, but over the longer term, yeah, I beat the market.

However, it\u2019s important to recognize that GCP,  Azure, and AWS hold a significantly larger share of the cloud market (including DWHousing) and that is not going to change any time soon.  Additionally, the aforementioned service platforms are heavily investing into and improving multi-cloud capabilities to compete.  In this context, I believe Snowflake may struggle to compete with the likes of BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse, etc. in the near future.  If you want some examples, look into BigQuery OMNI or BigLake.  Finally, pricing features like storage and compute separation/decoupling are available on the other cloud platforms as well (they have various pricing models to select from, including on-demand).",

        "post_body": "Hello there, I've been trading stocks and options for about 6 years, and I've gotten some decent returns, ranging from close to 45% returns per year from the past 2 years or so. I know this isn't strictly value investing, but I use a combination of technical analysis, quantitative analysis and fundamental analysis to get decent returns.\n\nI've condensed it to a four-step process: **Finding trending stocks**, stocks with at least **2B market cap**, **oversold stocks** and **stocks with healthy financials.**\n\n**1. Trending stocks**\n\nTrending stocks can be determined through their implied volatility. I use websites like [barcharts.com](https://www.barchart.com/options/highest-implied-volatility/highest?sector=stock&orderBy=baseLastPrice&orderDir=desc) to find the highest IV stocks of the day (I like stocks > $10 for better option premiums), and keep it in a watchlist.\n\n**2. Minimum mid-market cap stocks**\n\nBy definition, mid-market cap stocks range from 2-10B. The reason for choosing minimum mid-market cap stocks is due to their float. Stocks with larger floats are more resistant to price manipulations and violent price swings.\n\n**3. Oversold stocks**\n\nWe can determine oversold stocks through the RSI. When stocks on my watchlist go under RSI 30, it is the perfect time to enter a position. As the saying goes \"the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets\".\n\n**4. Healthy financials**\n\nFinally, the value investing component of this process - picking stocks with healthy financials. I look at the QoQ net profit margin (is the company making money?), debt, quick ratio (their liquid assets on hand), their short float, along with other positive [green ratios on Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CELH&p=w).\n\n**Advantages of this strategy:**\n\n**\u2022** **Increased option premiums:** Higher IV stocks have higher option premiums and larger price movements due to increased 'hype' and news coverage.\n\n**\u2022** **Risk mitigation**: Of course no strategy is zero risk. However, buying oversold stocks with good financials increases the resistance of a falling stock's price. You can consider selling puts at major support levels to collect premiums and get assigned. In the event where the stock's price goes lower than expected, you can roll your sell put option further out.\n\nI'll be documenting the stocks that have have been filtered using this strategy [on my Instagram (@wavystonks)](https://www.instagram.com/wavystonks/), so do check out the stocks that I've listed down there!\n\nI'm welcome to comments and constructive criticism, so let's help each other out in determining the best possible way where we can make money together :)",

They discuss strategies for identifying trending stocks and high-growth potential companies.\n\nOne thing to consider is that high IV stocks can be risky. While they offer higher premiums, they're also more volatile and unpredictable. Make sure you're comfortable with the potential downside.\n\nThe 2B market cap minimum is smart for reducing manipulation risk. And using RSI to find oversold stocks is a solid technical indicator.\n\nOverall, it's a well-thought-out strategy. Just remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. 45% annual returns are impressive but hard to sustain long-term. Keep refining your approach and stay disciplined with risk management.",

Perhaps follow me on [https://www.instagram.com/wavystonks/](https://www.instagram.com/wavystonks/) for future updates? \n\nI'll try to answer all your questions here:  \n- I usually use the Wheel strategy to generate premiums from selling puts and calls. Usually I'll sell put at major support > get assigned > sell call @ +1/2 strikes above\n\n- Personally, I've never experienced a loss when all 4 criterias are met. However, it's tough finding stocks that meet all 4 criterias. In the past I've taken punts on smaller cap and financially unsound stocks that have made losses, and this has led me from steering clear from them. \n\n- Small cap stocks in my opinion can go against you very quickly and are hard to predict where they might end up. Price manipulation is a very real thing with hedge funds and I don't wanna be caught up with that. \n\n- In general, it really depends on what the outlook of the market is. For e.g. we know for certain that there's positive periods such as the Santa rally (25 dec - 1 week Jan) and July Effect, and negative periods such as in September, May and February. So I would adjust my selling price accordingly, but usually try to sell it at major resistance levels.",

If and when the market swoons, these candidates will be excellent choices to choose from, and the time to do the DD is before the market slow down :)\n\nMy Quality metrics include the following characteristics:\n\n* Growth in revenue, earnings,\n* Evidence of free cash flow and FCF margin\n* Consistency in the efficient allocation of capital\n\nWhat we want to see in small companies are fast growers that are growing market share rapidly. However some of them are usually unprofitable initially while they overspend on marketing to grow sales.\n\nIt is more challenging to sieve out companies that are growing into profitabilty or transiting from a negative fcf state into a positive one. I will likely do a first pass for the obvious profitable candidates first and then do another pass for those growing into profitability.\n\nHere is my first pass, best rated company is at the top. Out of the 84, i liked these 6 best.\n\n(swipe left / right to see the columns)\n\n|ticker|Name|Market Cap & Employees|Sector|Rev|P/E / Normalised|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1  QLYS|Qualys Inc|$4.62 B / 2,269|Technology/ Software|581m|27.69/21.33|\n|2  MPWR|Monolithic Power Systems Inc|45.98 Bil / 3,564|Technology / Semiconductors|1,894.20m|112.29  /79.00|\n|3  TREX|Trex Co Inc|7.11 B / 1,765|Industrials / Building Products & Equipment|1,249.69m|27.02 / 27.17|\n|4 BJ|BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc|$11.32 Bil/ 34,000|Consumer Defensive / Discount Stores|20,405.92m|21.56 / 21.19|\n|5 BCPC|Balchem Corp|5.59 B / 1,290|Basic Materials / Specialty Chemicals|932.39m|47.88 / 41.94|\n|6 NOVT|Novanta Inc|6.33 B / 2,900|Technology / Scientific & Technical Instruments|899.85m|102.51 / 59.76|\n\n(BJ may seem odd choice for this \"small caps fund\", as the nos of employees  and market cap puts it in the realm of the large cap.

This was largely achieved through advances in technology that have now become essential to daily life through the entire worlds population in a shockingly short period of time (last 10 years).

The S&P 500 is heavily weighted towards large-cap tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, which have seen insane growth over the past decade. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 is made up of smaller companies that haven't benefited as much from the tech revolution.\n\nAlso, small-cap stocks tend to be more volatile and sensitive to economic cycles. They got hit harder during downturns like COVID and took longer to recover. Big companies in the S&P 500 had more resources to weather the storm and adapt quickly.\n\nThat said, don't count out small-caps just yet. Historically, they've outperformed large-caps over very long periods. We might see a rotation back to small-caps if the market decides big tech is overvalued or if there's a shift in economic conditions that favors smaller, more nimble companies.",

It can take over 10y for this to happen with an average of 2y (most companies already crashed by then)\nBecause so, while Russel does have great companies, there are also shitty companies. Most people today just track SP or the best companies out of it (by sector or personal preference). \n\nThe rise in SP is mostly due to two things:\n- IA boom, most trackers are heavily Tech invested, including SPY. So it's been growing due to the IA gains while many other companies in SP500 are going down.\n- rise in passive investing. Many people are doing automatic tracker investing with many new content about ETFs popularizing. This is at the same time keeping the indexes up and sustaining this crazy bull run with incredible high P/Es.\n\nNow, after the election we will see 4 major things happening:\n- All this volatility in stocks will ease and reduce option pricing. Many people will be forced to exercise or exit their positions.\n- Stocks will go down and have a severe correction (this can happen within 1 day or 6 months after results but be prepared)\n- New corrected job reports will be posted by the new president and they will point towards a recession). This can influence stocks into a further sellout.\n- Those corrections will make a lot of the new investors remove their money, making a further correction.\nThis can be temporarily and show as a buying opportunity or definitely and drag down those PEs to the floor.\n\nEven so, it's easier to see small IA companies built during hype be crushed than to expect IWM to outperform SPY.",

The 'real PE' of the Russell is far higher than normally stated.

        "post_body": "**Cisarua Mountain Dairy (Ticker: $CMRY)**, also known as Cimory, is a fast growing premium dairy company in Indonesia, where annual per capita\u00a0milk\u00a0consumption is just 16 kg, far behind SE Asian neighbours like Thailand (44 kg) and Vietnam (26 kg). As incomes rise and purchasing power increases, Indonesians are likely to adopt Western dietary habits, creating significant growth potential in the local dairy market.\n\nCimory is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and has already shown impressive growth since its IPO in 2021, with a 5-year revenue CAGR of 53% and net profit of 84%. It holds a solid balance sheet, with zero debt and a net cash position equal to 2x FY23 earnings.\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed Cimory\u2019s fundamentals and valuation in my latest report.
