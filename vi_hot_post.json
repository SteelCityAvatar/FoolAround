I beleive its very underrated metric.  **Retained earnings** represent the cumulative total of earnings that a company has yet to pay to shareholders and is found on the Balance Sheet.  While the number itself is less important - what is important to me is the overall trajectory of retained earnings - i.e its growth and growth rate.\u00a0 I want to see the retained earning growing from year to year hopefully at a rapid pace.\u00a0 Typically I look at least 5 years of retained earnings.  It can tell us a lot about the compounding ability of a stock.",

CPRI trades at .77 times sales and has 65% gross margins implying that net could be in the 15% range in time if tpr takes over or the CO gets its act together. If cpri trades down to $30 its a no brainier to me esp if you have time and don't mind collecting a 4% dividend while you wait it out.",
