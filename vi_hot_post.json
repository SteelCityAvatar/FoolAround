        "post_date": "2024-04-28T18:25:49",
        "post_body": "Cooper-Standard, a leader and global suppliers of sealing systems and component, fuel and brake delivery, and fluid transfer systems was a pre-pandemic money tree cranking out over $8 EPS. During the pandemic, when global light vehicle production was cast into the depths of hell, multiple competitors within the space were forced to close shop; although $CPS remained afloat it did not come out unscathed. Instead, the stock plummeted into freefall, and was down over 90% from it's all-time high. But like my grandma says, when there is blood in the streets, buy real estate. And gentlemen, I have opened $CPS as my largest position and it's my 2024 best-performer pick. Let me explain why.\n\nDuring the pandemic, global light vehicle production volumes fell to a low of 77.6 million units in 2020. Mr. Fu Bingfeng, President of OICA, described the sharp downtrend as \"the worst crisis ever to impact the automotive industry.\" Due to being inherently dependent on light vehicle production, Cooper Standard's top line was obliterated. They went from an untouchable EPS and EBITDA monster to complete stagnation.\n\nWith production annihilated, it is no surprise that eight auto parts suppliers filed for bankruptcy between 2020 and 2021. While Cooper-Standard survived the chaos, revenues declined by over 35%, and shareholders experienced a 90% drop in share price. During the post-pandemic recovery, another major headwind emerged. The UAW strike once again halted light vehicle production for three of Cooper Standard's largest customers. Today, these obstacles have been successfully navigated, and the ascent to reclaim the throne has never been more clear.\n\nLight vehicle production is now on a tear for a multitude of reasons. First, the average age of a vehicle on the road is currently sitting at an all time high of 13.6 years. That coupled with the fact that current domestic auto-inventory sits at 1.4 months (meaning the current stock of automobiles could only supply 1.4 months of sales) creates a huge impetus to start cranking out vehicles. And vehicle production = $CPS profits. Better yet, the vehicle production numbers from Q1 2024 are significantly exceeding consensus predictions. In every month in 2024 to date, vehicle sales have been significantly higher than in 2023. In March alone, vehicle sales were more than 100,000 units greater in 2024 than in 2023.\n\nThis boom in vehicle production and sales has lifted all major automakers than have already reported 1Q earnings, as they continue to beat and raise guidance.\n\nAs far as the financials are concerned, $CPS revenue and adjusted EBITDA show a clear inflection point in 2021, and with leaner costs from restructuring, coupled with the vehicle production turnaround, $CPS is poised to head to the moon gentlemen. Despite the clear path forward, the stock continues to trade \\~85% lower than its ATH. A major reason for this was the conservative guidance set forth by management at the Q4 earnings call, but during the call, the CEO of the company himself said, \"*Clearly, our light vehicle production units and the guidance that we've used for '24, you can see there are -- continue to be a bit conservative, I guess, is how I would describe it.*\" Well, the numbers coming in so far for 24 are far from the conservative estimates put forth by management, and I expect a resounding beat will be the result at their Q1 call in two weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: As mentioned above, I have opened a position in $CPS and as always do your own DD.",

However, it's also not cheap to host this platform, and I need to strike a balance between usefulness and cost-effectiveness.\n\n[My full thoughts are here.](https://medium.com/p/120ce4c90e3c) I'm really curious to get some feedback on how algorithmic trading can be applied to value investing, and what particular features are you looking out for in such a platform.",

                "comment_body": "Just to add to what others have said:\n\n1) it\u2019s so that you can evaluate the business on its own merits.  Financial engineering is a real thing, compare a property rental company where they can buy assets with either 100% cash or 10% cash and 90% debt - the debt holders only receive a fixed income while any profits above this go directly to the shareholders after taxes, which means the return on investment can be hugely affected by the debt levels.  Therefore the merits of the business itself can be distorted by debt.\n\n2) It gives a clearer picture on how much debt a company can repay.\n\n3) Debt can distort the apparent value of a company, especially when using an earnings multiple as a valuation technique (e.g. a PE ratio). There are a few different ways that this could cause an error in judgement here: a) say EBIT is $100 and interest $90 leaving a profit of $8 after tax (at 20%), if companies in this industry are usually valued at a PE of 15, then you might think that the company should be worth $120 ($8 x 15).  But what if the company only has a year or two left on its loans?   Then the value would be radically different.  b) Another scenario, using the same figures above, is what if the company is growing very rapidly?  Using the same multiple to value both the business and the debt would clearly be an error in valuation. i.e. if earnings before tax in the following year is $200, the year after that $400, and the year after that $800, and if the debt and interest rates have remained unchanged at  just $90 interest per year, then applying an earnings multiple to the after interest figure would probably under value the company.\n\n4) A company is made up of the business itself (the assets, working capital, staff etc) and how it is financed (capital structure).  Debt is very easy to place a value on and usually the balance sheet figure is sufficient, though there can be exceptions that I won\u2019t get into.  So why complicate your evaluation of a business when you can simply deduct the debt at the end of your evaluation?  Having debt in the evaluation complicates things unnecessarily.  Again, there are exceptions, especially if the company has either significant debt - where a closer examination of the cash flows would be required, or very little debt - could be ignored for simplicity purposes.",

It is good to check some articles to confirm own research results but without own efforts those articles are useless noise. The challenge is to process the data mentioned.

I would assume it would take more than 10 professionals doing it 160 hours monthly and yet they would just read and not doing research, not consolidate data into tables, not write reports. Realistically it would take  hundreds people to process this. Note the 10k reports becoming older every day after they posted.\n\nOf cause we could use some screeners to reduce data amount, but any ways it is a lot of work to do.\n\nCan I ask how much time you spending or expect to spend every month doing your personal research and how long does it takes to you to research one company up to  decision you want to own it?",

It doubled its revenue over the past 12 years through organic growth and acquisitions. It achieved a growing ROE with corresponding improvements in operating efficiencies. \n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/xCfGy3j6/Ternium.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xCfGy3j6/Ternium.png)\n\nWhen I last valued it a couple of weeks ago, there was a margin of safety.

There's a reason that only Tesla has really come out of the US as a major automaker startup, while other industries such as finance, tech, healthcare, entertainment, and energy have seen hundreds of companies successfully enter the market and establish themselves well.\n\nYou need to sell billions in cars to break even, while a tech startup basically just needs to cover employee cost, server cost, and marketing",

In return, they move their operations to a new entity where Aker keeps 20% ownership and SLB 80%. SLB also adds their carbon business to the JV for 0.5B NOK which is around the remaining cash Aker has now.\n\nHave been trying to wrap my head around what this means for investors in Aker. Do they hold a share of this cash in exchange for a 5x dilution in the new joint venture company? Or is it something else? \n\nAppreciate any answers from anyone who had something similar.

Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",

        "post_body": "Alphabet and Microsoft are sending a clear message to investors: AI and Cloud Computing are two industries that are paying off.\r  \n\r  \nBoth companies released their earnings, and let us tell you, they did GREAT. Alphabet surged as much as 12%, pushing their [valuation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-parent-alphabet-reclaims-spot-2-trillion-valuation-club-2024-04-26/)past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose by as much as 3.5%, which is an impressive gain for them. \r  \n\r  \n**The Main Details:**\r  \n**Alphabet:**\r\n\n* New cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, the first in the company's history. \r\n* The board of directors also approved stock buybacks of around $70 billion. \r\n* Total revenue rose 16% from the same period last year.\r\n* Earnings per share beat estimates: $1.89 vs $1.53 expected.\r\n* Cloud revenue rose 30%, and Ad revenue rose 13%.\n\n**Microsoft:**\r\n\n* Total revenue rose 17%, and Profits rose 20%.\r\n* Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected.\r\n* Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud Segment rose 21%.\r\n* Azure and other cloud services rose 31%.\r\n* LinkedIn revenue rose 12%, Xbox revenue rose 62%, and PC revenue rose 18%.\n\nBoth tech titans are locked in a battle over the dominance of the AI field, but it seems as yesterday's results show that the market thinks these two companies have room to grow together.\r\n\n**Generative AI**\r  \n2024 is the year of generative AI, and it looks as though technology that can create text, images, and videos with prompts is here to stay. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAi to challenge Google\u2019s two-decade dominance of the internet, but Alphabet's own generative AI, Gemini, isn\u2019t too far back. \r\n\nThe space is becoming competitive, with both Alphabet and Microsoft executives saying their generative AI programs are driving more business for their cloud computing services. Corporate customers are also more open to making long-term investments in cloud infrastructure, increasing their trust in both companies.\r\n\nGenerative AI is giving a reason for corporations to come back and continue to use the cloud services of their company of choice. This gives the volatile tech industry some stability, with new demand and revenue coming in for both companies. \r\n\n**Google\u2019s Trailing Cloud Services** \n\nThis new intake in demand for cloud computing is a welcome turn for Google, which has long lagged behind industry veterans Amazon and Microsoft. After breaking even for the first time last year, the unit is now viewed as one of Google\u2019s fastest-growing businesses and best bet for growth as its core search advertising unit matures. Google\u2019s cloud operations pulled off a first-quarter profit of $900 million, well above analyst predictions of $672.4 million. \r\n\n**Gemini Comeback**\r\n\nGoogle\u2019s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks it had in the generative AI consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model, formally known as Bard but now rebranded to Gemini, was criticized for answering prompts with historically inaccurate images, promoting the company to stop generating pictures and depictions of people with its software.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since that obstacle, Google has been able to turn things around with Gemini. The enterprise product has told a very different story as the professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help ensure that the content released by the model stays consistent with their brand messaging to avoid mistakes like in Q1. Enterprise Gemini can be used to produce ads, videos, and podcasts.\r  \n\r  \n**Microsoft's Domination**\r\n\nThe narrative has been completely different for Google, with domination from the get-go. Generative AI has been an avenue for enterprise clients to spend more with Microsoft. The tech company has been infusing AI into the entire core product line with its technology partner OpenAI. \r  \n\r  \nThe bet is starting to pay off as customers are adding Microsoft\u2019s AI tools to help summarize documents and generate content. Alongside the addition of Copilat, Microsoft reported a 31% climb in revenue for its Azure cloud computing program, beating analysts expectations. 7% of this increase was attributed to AI which is a big deal. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub coding platform is also gaining more traction, recording 1.8 million new customers during this period an increase from 1.3 million of last quarter. This is largely due to their AI-coding assistant powered by OpenAI\u2019s largue language model, helping programmers streamline their code, answer any questions, and even convert code from one programming language to another. \r  \n\r  \nThe company is also seeing a large intake in their AI assistance tool meant to work synonymously with their Office suite software. The new tool costs companies an extra $30 a month on top of their existing subscriptions. Corporate customers are many in number including Goldman Sachs, Ford Motors, and Ernst & Young. Microsoft estimates that roughly 60% of the Fortune 500 uses Copilat.\n\n*Btw I wanna give credit where it's due:* [*This analysis was from here*](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe) ",

I wouldn't worry about it being too expensive or lacking near term growth if we're talking about long term and since you don't need the money any time soon that's kind of what I'm assuming.\n\n4) Carve out a little from point #3 to play with and invest as you see fit.  Since you say you've been following the market it seems like some part of you is interested in active trading and investments in general.  Use this to take care of that itch, learn more about the markets, and not blow up your entire equity if you make some bad plays.\n\nEither way it's cool you're already thinking about this at 21.

Id definitely reconsider SPY/VOO for great long-term performance and low fees. \n\nBasically, just keep saving while you chill and enjoy life and you'll be set.

I think Fairfax Financial FFH.TO or FRFHF makes great sense for up to 50% of the portfolio. It\u2019s very diversified and has a good shot at 5x in 10 years. Normally, that kind of concentration doesn\u2019t make sense but your portfolio is growing fast given your savings rate. E-L Financial ELF.TO or ELFIF, for 45% makes sense. It\u2019s like buying the market at a 50% discount so it\u2019s market return + how much the discount closes. The key is the high margin of safety. If you like gold, the final 5% in Mako Mining MKO.V or MAKOF makes sense. It\u2019s trading at a 20% FCF yield before growth and they have high return plans for the cash. In a gold bull, it could 10x in 10 years. It\u2019s controlled by Wexford Capital so it has grown up supervision unlike most gold companies and there is way more leverage with operators vs the metal itself.

Also if at any point repayments are late, then impairments are recognised. E.g. under IFRS 9 rules it can be in 3 risk weighting stages, stage 1 is fine, stage 2 you need to recognise a %  as impairments but can still recognise interest payments, stage 3 large % is impaired and interest it put into ECL (expected credit losses). So basically if the borrower is prime and repays fully its quite simple, but subprime gets complicated as you recognise losses upfront, but they will be later adjusted depending upon what actually happens. IMO its why credit as a % of GDP is far less to sub prime since 08 as banks simply aren't as profitable. Whereas mortgages still very safe and lucrative, but competitive.",

        "post_date": "2024-04-26T08:29:25",
        "post_body": "\r  \n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR) \r  \n\r  \nStory by Andrew Bary\r  \n\r  \nWarren Buffett will be at center stage, as usual, during Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting. But investors are increasingly looking for clues on what the company will be like when the longstanding CEO and chairman is no longer running it.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire could come under pressure to break itself up when the world\u2019s most acclaimed investor exits the stage. It might decide to pay a dividend rather than amass cash, as it does today while Buffett, 93, waits for investing opportunities. Buffett can expect to face questions on all these topics and more at the annual meeting on May 4 in Omaha, Neb.\r  \n\r  \nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett\u2019s longtime friend, business partner, and Berkshire vice chairman, who died last year at 99, won\u2019t be at his side. Munger\u2019s absence will only reinforce the obvious: Buffett\u2019s time atop the conglomerate he built over six decades could end during the next few years. Even Buffett acknowledges as much, writing in November that he felt \u201cgood\u201d but was \u201cplaying in extra innings.\u201d\r  \n\n\nFor some 30,000 Berkshire shareholders expected to attend the meeting, the future will be the focus as Buffett fields questions for more than five hours in what could be his only public appearance of the year. Joining Buffett on the dais will be Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, likely tasked with the role of Buffett\u2019s successor as CEO, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, who runs the company\u2019s insurance operations. Together they will answer questions small and large: Can the stock beat the S&P 500 index? Why have share repurchases declined since 2021? Can the company\u2019s new management prove anywhere as capable as Buffett? Should Berkshire break up?\r  \n\r  \nBut really, everyone will be focused on the same thing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhether it\u2019s said out loud or not, succession is front and center on the minds of investors,\u201d says Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst.\r  \n\r  \nThere is nothing like Berkshire. It has had an extraordinary run since Buffett took control of a struggling textile maker in 1965 and turned it into the world\u2019s largest conglomerate, with nearly 400,000 employees and U.S.-centric businesses that offer one of the best reads on the health of the economy. Some of its largest divisions are the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad; Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which operates a multistate electric utility business that is one of the largest producers of green power in the country; and the world\u2019s biggest property and casualty insurer, including Geico, the No. 3 auto insurer.\r  \n\r  \nThere are smaller units, such as NetJets, the leader in private jet travel; Clayton Homes, the top maker of manufactured housing; Benjamin Moore paints; Dairy Queen; and one of the largest real estate brokerage businesses in the country. Then there is a $360 billion equity portfolio led by Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Berkshire\u2019s holdings. There also is what Buffett calls a Fort Knox balance sheet, with nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire isn\u2019t run like other conglomerates. It is unusually decentralized, with Buffett leaving key decisions at subsidiaries largely to the managers of the individual companies. He wrote in the Berkshire \u201cOwner\u2019s Manual\u201d in 2017 that \u201cwe delegate almost to the point of abdication.\u201d Berkshire has a tiny headquarters staff of 26 with no corporate counsel, investor relations, or public relations staff.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire\u2019s unusual strategy has worked. The company is expected to generate $40 billion of after-tax operating earnings this year and has a market capitalization of $880 billion, the seventh-largest in the stock market. The company\u2019s Class A stock has risen to over $600,000 a share from $20 (there have been no stock splits along the way) since Buffett took over in 1965, and holders who bought the now widely held Class B shares when they were created in 1996 have seen that stock rise 20-fold. It\u2019s one of the most widely held stocks by individuals, with some three million shareholders. Probably no other company elicits the passion and loyalty of its investor base. Big institutions have never appreciated the stock as much as individuals.\r  \n\r  \nBut will they continue to, once Buffett is no longer running the show? So central is Buffett to Berkshire\u2019s business that four or five people will take over the role that he maintained until 2018, when he delegated responsibility for Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses to Abel and the insurance operations to Jain.\r  \n\r  \nAbel is due to become CEO, which involves overseeing Berkshire\u2019s vast array of businesses and likely determining capital allocation, a critical role at the company that Buffett has performed so well for nearly 60 years. That means deciding whether to use earnings to repurchase stock, pay dividends, build cash, or make acquisitions. Jain is likely to remain head of the insurance business, while Buffett\u2019s older son, Howard, 69, a farmer and philanthropist, probably will become nonexecutive chairman.\r  \n\r  \nThen there are Todd Combs, 53, and Ted Weschler, 61, who now run about 10% of Berkshire\u2019s equity investments and probably will run the entire portfolio. Berkshire doesn\u2019t say which stocks in the equity portfolio are run by Combs and Weschler, but Berkshire watchers think that many of the smaller holdings\u2014under $4 billion\u2014are theirs. These include Charter Communications, DaVita, Liberty Sirius XM, Amazon.com, Snowflake, Visa, and Mastercard. Buffett hasn\u2019t commented on their performance relative to the market since 2019\u2014when he said they were slightly behind it since joining the company more than a decade ago. We estimate that both are probably lagging behind the market since their tenures began, given the underperformance of some of their rumored holdings in recent years.\r  \n\r  \nInvestment manager Bill Smead, who heads the Smead Value fund, would like to hear from Combs and Weschler. \u201cNot introducing Todd and Ted is an unforgivable sin. If Warren dies tomorrow, they are the stockpickers, and they have never answered or been asked a question at the annual meeting.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCombs is a key member of the Berkshire bench and could be a backup to Abel as the Buffett successor or a potential successor to Abel as CEO. Combs has a good rapport with Buffett and has experience beyond investments as CEO of Geico for past four years and as a JPMorgan Chase board member. One candidate to succeed Jain as head of the insurance operations is Joe Brandon, who runs Alleghany, an insurer that Berkshire bought in 2022.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett\u2019s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett\u2019s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett\u2019s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\r  \n\r  \nAn important question, asked or not, is what will happen to Berkshire shares when Buffett steps down or dies. They may take a hit of perhaps 5% to 10%, as longtime holders cash out and investors worry that the Buffett magic will disappear. Buffett, though, has said he thinks the stock will go up on the day after his death as investors anticipate a value-enhancing corporate breakup.\r  \n\r  \nThere\u2019s a case to be made for a breakup. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest conglomerate at a time when conglomerates have fallen out of favor, with the likes of General Electric and United Technologies having broken up in recent years. For all of Buffett\u2019s investment acumen and business smarts, Berkshire stock is about even with the S&P 500 as measured by total return over the past 10 years and 20 years, Bloomberg calculations show. The stock has returned 12.4% annually over the past 10 years, against 12.5% for the S&P 500. Buffett has said that Berkshire needs to top it over time or investors should consider looking elsewhere.\r  \n\r  \nAll the massive outperformance came in Buffett\u2019s first 40 years at the helm, when the company was smaller and Buffett had a particularly hot investment hand, scooping up big stakes in companies like Coca-Cola and American Express at cheap prices. Size, too, is an impediment to outsize returns.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett hasn\u2019t had a lot of new winners in the past decade. The company\u2019s largest acquisition\u2014the 2016 purchase of Precision Castparts for $33 billion\u2014has been a bust. Buffett has had some misses in the stock market, selling a group of financial stocks including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase in 2020 and 2021 at about half their current prices. Of course, Apple has been a huge win with Berkshire\u2019s stake, now worth over $150 billion, compared with a cost of around $30 billion. But the iPhone giant is having a rough 2024, and its stock is down more than10% year to date.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire shares look like a good bet to match or beat the S&P 500 even after Buffett leaves the scene. The stock now looks appealing, valued at 1.5 times its projected March 31 book value of nearly $400,000 per Class A share and for 22 times estimated 2024 earnings. (Berkshire is due to report its first-quarter results on May 4.) Berkshire is slightly expensive relative to its five-year average of 1.4 times book value. The stock is ahead of the market this year and over the past five years.\r  \n\r  \nBook value is an old-fashioned valuation measure but is still relevant for Berkshire because of its large insurance operations\u2014insurers still get valued on book\u2014and because it has been a historical yardstick for the company since Buffett took over.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett chooses to focus on intrinsic value but doesn\u2019t disclose his estimate of that figure. Buffett has said that book value is a greatly understated proxy for intrinsic value, although share repurchases at current prices do reduce book value, somewhat undercutting the use of that measurement.\r  \n\r  \nPost Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s stock is likely to be supported by steady growth in its earnings and shareholder equity over time. The company appears capable of high-single-digit annual growth in book value based on $40 billion of operating income after taxes and gains in the $360 billion equity portfolio. If the stock keeps pace with the growth in book value, it could show similar share price growth.\r  \n\r  \nA dividend is a good bet within a few years of Buffett\u2019s death. Why? It will help his successor disburse some of the annual operating earnings. Another reason is that investors won\u2019t be so tolerant of Berkshire holding so much cash\u2014a record $168 billion at year-end 2023\u2014without Buffett at the helm.\r  \n\r  \nChristopher Bloomstran, chief investment strategist at Semper Augustus Investment Group, wrote earlier this year that Berkshire stock could generate a 10% to 11% annualized return over the next 10 years, with annual share buybacks in the 2% to 3% range\u2014above the recent rate of 1% to 1.5%. He pegged intrinsic value at around $720,000 a share.\r  \n\r  \nUBS analyst Brian Meredith is one of the few Berkshire bulls among Wall Street analysts. He recently lifted his price target to about $722,000 per Class A share from $715,000. He sees improvement at both Geico and Burlington Northern. Berkshire is one of the most defensive big stocks in the market, given its balance sheet and earnings power. A market selloff could offer opportunities for Buffett.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett is firmly against a breakup. He argues the conglomerate structure has numerous attributes, including tax benefits from the ability to quickly make use of any big catastrophe losses at Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies. Buffett has expressed confidence in the company\u2019s future, writing last year that \u201cBerkshire has been built to last.\u201d And the company\u2019s Buffett-friendly 14-member board\u2014including two of Buffett\u2019s kids\u2014is well aware of his views.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBerkshire has been run with enormous transparency, integrity, a long-term orientation, and a culture of stewardship. It is run by the greatest investor in history. That\u2019s the present,\u201d Chris Davis, an investment manager and Berkshire board member, told Barron\u2019s last year. \u201cAs for the future, every activist and investment banker will argue that in a world without Warren and Charlie, Berkshire\u2019s unorthodox structure shouldn\u2019t persist. I think it\u2019s worth defending.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhatever the questions, Berkshire shareholders will savor the annual meeting, knowing there may not be many more with Buffett at the helm. As for the stock, many may heed the advice of Munger, who said that \u201cthey should keep the faith\u201d rather than sell after he and Buffett are gone.",

        "post_body": "**Warren Buffett or Not, Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is Built to Last**\r  \nQuestions are swirling about succession, a possible dividend, even a breakup of the company. The case for buying the stock now.\r  \nBy \r Andrew Bary\r  \nUpdated April 26, 2024, 2:25 pm EDT / Original April 26, 2024, 12:30 am EDT\n\n==============================\n\n**Article Preview:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ce018n/barrons\\_26th\\_april\\_warren\\_buffett\\_or\\_not/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ce018n/barrons_26th_april_warren_buffett_or_not/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n==============================  \n\n\n**Article Link:** https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-stock-price-warren-buffett-succession-4ab47394?mod=hp\\_HERO\n\n\r  \n==============================  \n\n\n**Quote**:\n\nBuffett\u2019s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett\u2019s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett\u2019s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\n\n========================================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

However the useless CEO has been kicked out which makes this a potential recovery play IF a new good CEO is found that does the following:\n\n- Stops wasting capex on poor ROIC projects like small games and other stuff\n\n- Focuses their investment on fixing Payday3 and making it actually something decent.\n\n- Immediately cancels the Dungeons and Dragons shit IP they have bought (really they should focus on multiplayer shooting games only...)\n\n- Shuts down the third party publishing business\n\n- Fires 50% of the team\n\nThis is kind of similar to Meta in 2022, investors were pricing in zuckerberg just continuing to act like a robot and throwing money down the train at VR.\n\nIf a good CEO is found it's possible this could change.\n\nWhat the new CEO needs to do it fire a bunch of people as soon as they join and streamline the company.\n\nThe issue is they have an interim CEO who was an old board member and looks useless as well to me.\n\nThe question is, how much is the Payday brand still worth after they fucked up Payday3 SO badly?\n\nPayday3 only has 200 concurrent players now, whereas Payday2 has 17k. Even though it's an old title it still retains huge numbers and will still generate profit with more DLC.\n\nThoughts? I think this all depends on the new CEO but this looks like one of the situations where it probably can't get any worse given they have no debt, new potential management and cash on hand IF they get a good perm CEO\n\nI think this is worth putting on a watchlist and waiting if a new CEO comes in that isn't an idiot.\n\n>**The Board of Directors of Starbreeze has appointed the current board member Juergen Goeldner as interim CEO of Starbreeze, taking office with immediate effect.

Microsoft's Take\n\nLike Google, Microsoft is second to none in terms of consistent execution and drama-less profitable compounding.

Fastenal is paying out the bulk of its free cash flow as dividends, the dividend ratio is approaching 70% and it has been growing its dividend at a rate of 12% a year for the last 10 years. In fact, Fastenal just made it to the Dividend Aristocrat list, companies which has increased its dividend every year for the last 25 years.\n\nI look at the slowing growth of Fastenal and the need to payout so much of the earnings to dividends plus the need to increase the dividend annually as quite stressful when compared to Simpson Mfg, where the payout ratio is only 30% and the annualized dividend increase is about been 7%. \n\nBottom line, SSD has got more potential upside to be rated at a higher multiple than FAST whereas for Fast, if the business slows down too much, and they cannot increase their dividend, the stock will fall quite dramatically as the dividend investors move elsewhere.\n\nDo you agree with my assessment ?",

I expect more share repurchases to be announced with earnings, which should continue to help juice EPS.\n\nI'm not understanding why the market is ignoring the massive share repurchases the company continues to do. Apple bought back ~1.5 billion shares in the past three years alone, having spent:\n- $82.6 billion in 2021\n- $89.6 billion in 2022\n- $79.2 billion in 2023\n\nLast quarter they ended with $173 billion in cash/marketable securities versus $108 billion in debt. The CFO reiterated the long-term plan to go cash neutral. So with a net cash position of $65 billion, I expect Apple bought back a significant chunk of shares in Q1 and might even be a record for share repurchases last quarter.\n\nI know iPhone growth isn't encouraging, but services continue to grow at a double digit clip. With the share repurchases and healthy growth in services, why isn't Apple trading at a higher multiple? To me it seems like a deep value play relative to the other mega cap stocks and a no brainer to buy and hold. \n\nWhy is the market relatively so bearish on Apple?",

There is a risk that as a counter reaction, Chinese government can ban Apple. Their revenue numbers (and even supply) could be impacted from any such action.\n* Apple is now nearly 50% of Warren Buffet's total holding. It's not a matter of if, but when he trims the Apple stock, which may tank Apple.\n* Despite their price drop, the P/E ratio for Apple is still 26.49, which is not cheap by any account.",

They had a huge 2022 net loss due to impairment which means they invested a lot of money into some really poor games.\n\nWhat's interesting about them is they have:\n\n* No debt\n* A lot of cash\n* A terribly low share price\n* Management has very large stakes in the company and is incentivzed\n* New management is the original founders who made it successful in the first place\n* A back catalogue such as cult of the lamb which continues to produce them decent revenues\n* Most importantly they have some upcoming games that could be big hits, Human Fall Flat 2, Plucky Squire (my personal favourite, it looks similar to 'It Takes Two', Baby Steps (made by the creator of 'Getting Over It' which is massive), Anger Foot (I have played the demo and it's really really fun, the soundtrack is amazing) etc.\n\nManagement has delayed the above releases to make sure they invest in them correctly so they are big hits like cult of the lamb was, i.e they need to hit an 85%+ on Metacritic and 'very positive' reviews on steam for a game to really have a chance of being big.\n\nDevolver digital are well known for high quality games.\n\nSome potential risks:\n\n* They need to stop acquiring any more companies or they run the risk of destroying value by overpaying, although most games companies are at all time lows to be fair.\n* They have to make sure the above games are hits, if not their stock price will tank even further.\n* The stock is very illiquid, it's very hard to buy so put small limit orders in if you do decide.\n* Games companies are a bit like gambling with the odds on your side, they have lumpy revenues and need hits to keep growing, obviously if these games flop it's a disaster.\n\nHave a look into it\n\nThanks",

        "post_body": "Hello all! I'm a college student who got into value investing around 2020. I've slowly been learning more as I go along, and I'd like some opinions on my portfolio\n\nDIS-40%. This is easily my biggest investment, and for good reason. The business itself has survived through multiple financial crisis, multiple leadership crisis, and a global pandemic, and is now in a state where they can fully take advantage of the market. Their park business is one of the best businesses out there, with a great moat, solid earnings, and great margins. The linear business has shown resilience in the face of cord cutting, the DTC business is really beginning to show its fruits, and could be a real driver of growth. Even if Disney+ fails, worst case, they can make a lot bidding their content away to the highest bidders on streaming, with players like Netflix, AppleTV, and Prime Video bidding the content price up. IMO, this is still very undervalued for how good of a business it is. \n\nINTC-16.5%. Another great business. Their revenue and earnings slowdown mainly come from a global demand shortage for consumer CPUs, which will begin to pick up in the future. Pat Gelsinger has proven to be a great CEO while at VMWare, and the business is currently priced as if the revenue growth will only come from the foundry business. The foundry part of the business has been operating for the entirety of Intel's history losing money, it's only that now that it's independent of the CPU arm that people are focusing on it. Worst case, they spin off the foundry business and become fabless. With their connections, strong revenue, and overall dominance over the CPU market, that business will still prove to be extremely strong. \n\nTCEHY-13%. This is less a bet on China and more a bet on Pony Ma and his investment acumen. Pony Ma has proven himself an extremely good executive, and with the vast, diverse, strong, and high margin business that spans international markets, this is a great business to buy. China is easing restrictions and wants foreign dollars again, which is proving itself in a recent semi-rally in Chinese stocks.\n\nCVS-10.5%. This is the business I'm the most likely to sell. I bought in because the revenue growth and overall business seems strong, but they bought a lot of that revenue growth, and the regulatory environment has turned SHARPLY against them. It seems increasingly likely that their core business will get attacked by competitors, and leadership at the company doesn't exactly spark confidence like other companies do. Increasingly seeming like a value trap. \n\nSOFI-10%. This is less of a bank and more of an overall financial stock. It's proven to be a great grower, and the company was trading at its TBVPS, so I bought in. Leadership knows what direction they're going in, and understand exactly how to funnel customers into their pipeline. \n\nBABA-8.5%. Another China bet. This comes from the overall strength of the balance sheet, the share buybacks, and the potential that BABA has in the cloud and international markets. I'd hope to see Jack Ma be allowed to come back to BABA, but that's unlikely. Still, with China easing restrictions, this company is increasingly seeming like a company people can actually invest in again. \n\nWMG-1%. This is more of a temporary percent. I plan on buying more in the future, but it seems like the price has been falling, so I'm waiting for more of an entry. Robert Kynci is a great executive and really helped to make YouTube what it is today. They are embracing tech more than any of the other large labels, and the business is in a state of really transforming towards the modern music market, while the other 2 major labels remain a bit stuck in their ways. Music is also an industry that is likely to see rapid growth based on the growth of Vinyl, streaming, and overall merchandising of artists. Data has continually shown that Gen-Z spends significantly more on experiences and wants to support artists, which provides a great opportunity for WMG. Don't let the temporary metrics stray you away from this business, as it's a great opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if the percentages don't add up. I'm rounding a bit with this. Thanks for free opinions here.",

Your analysis of DIS shows nothing the market does not already know - outsize positions should be reserved for those with a hidden something the market is yet to discover\n\n3. Your INTC analysis has \"great business\" and \"slowdown\" within a few words of each other. Nowhere in your analysis is any discussion of the reliance on subsidies to prop up and \"grow\"\n\n4. Your TCEHY analysis is confused: you say it is a bet on Pony Ma and end up discussing China's need for dollars? You'd be better off talking about how you think they'll monetise WeChat, how they'll meet the challenge of TikTok, how they'll leverage gaming to boost their cloud business. If I was betting on leaders like you are here, I'd be one of the funds bag holding Twitter with Elon right now\n\n5. CVS analysis focuses on the risks - why? Because the share price is down 20% recently? If you're investing in single names you need to do what Buffett did at AMX in the face of the salad oil scandal: understand the risks and understand what the market doesn't and buy it when it's down 50%. Your analysis shows me you'll be selling low and buying the next boat that's already being pushed by a rising tide, rather than buying the one that's beached and patiently waiting for the tide that's about to come in\n\n6. Your bullish view of SOFI means you don't discuss its purchase of banks (you criticise acquisitions elsewhere) nor its risk due to Biden's action on student loans (you mention ss a negative the regulation changes facing CVS, but not here?). You are betraying your biases. Investing should be done in a very cold way, applying the same standards everywhere. What are the risks facing this company? Why isn't it making money consistently? You don't answer the basics. Better off in an ETF that invests in the theme you bought this for. \n\n7. BABA is \"another China bet\" - I thought you said TCEHY wasn't a China bet? Again, your spitting what everyone knows: cloud, international. Surprised you didn't mention AI. If you want a China theme, you can get it via an ETF, but by punting in two names you're taking a risk of unknown proportion. You might come back in three years and your 22% in these two names has doubled and is now 30% of the portfolio. You'll be patting yourself on the back, and wondering why they aren't 44% of the portfolio seeing as they doubled...\n\n8. You're betting only 1% of your portfolio on WMG? which is trading at about 20x EV/EBITDA? This is so out of character: with that level of ovevaluation I'd expect this to be at least 20% of your portfolio\n\nI'd be liquidating everything and investing in low cost thematic ETFs. Find one for streaming (DIS, WMG), find one for China and Emerging Markets (TCEHY, BABA), find one for fin tech (TCEHY, SOFI), find one for healthcare (CVS), funds one for semis (INTC). That's five so 20% in each. And next time you see a company you like, find an ETF for it and make sure it's not an already existing theme in your portfolio and trim your existing winners to invest in the new one. Keep doing that until you have enough ETFs that don't duplicate risks. Rebalance regularly, trimming winners and adding to losers. \n\nYou asked for free opinions, and these only cost 2 cents.",

Lots of people are doing this on YouTube or TikTok. Disney et al used to have a huge market because of a lack of options.\n\n2. Word of mouth matters far more than marketing. The advantages of being a huge corporation rather than an indie studio in terms of getting an audience in has shrunk\n\n3. Audiences are far more aware of which movies are OK or good from social media and avoiding them in theaters and waiting for streaming. They are only going to movies that their friends rave about.\n\n4. There is growing international competition in entertainment and we are all now aware from various pieces of media that audiences are open to Korean or Japanese cinema and TV. Much of this seems to be made more efficiently than hollywood.\n\n5. The parks depend on producing great work, great characters and stories that resonate. Disney is failing to do this.",

        "post_date": "2024-04-25T06:17:43",
        "post_body": "\n**Key Insights:**  \nFLIC has shown remarkable resilience during major financial crises, including the 2008 global financial meltdown and the recent 2023 turmoil in the regional banking sector. Despite these strengths, its stock has been overlooked and is currently trading at levels similar to those seen in 2008-2009. When getting into the weeds you'll see FLIC has tons of liquidity, zero doubtful rated loans on the books, rock solid dividend yield and history, insiders consistently buying shares, corporate buy backs, owns the real estate of at least 20 of their 40 branch locations (in NYC/Long Island), upcoming earnings (after the bell today) and dirt-cheap options (low volume though so be careful).\n\n* **Aggressive Buybacks:** With a continuous $15 million buyback program and hefty insider purchases, there's a clear signal that those in the know believe in FLIC\u2019s future.\n\n* **Affordable Options:** The options market for FLIC is invitingly priced, providing a cost-effective way to potentially profit from future stock movements, just be careful as they are low volume typically. Hopefully we will see an uptick with earnings today.\n\n* **Proven Stability:** FLIC has navigated past financial storms with strategy and grace, bolstered by recent tech upgrades in fintech and cybersecurity.\n\n* **Financial Health:** Solid capital ratios underpin its ability to maintain operations and seek growth, enhancing its appeal as a robust investment.\n\n* **Attractive Dividend Yield:** For those looking for reliable income, FLIC\u2019s strong track record of dividends is a major draw, especially if you\u2019ve been burned by riskier bets this week. At first glance the yield at nearly 8% may appear unsustainable but when doing you DD you'll see that it is a sustainable number and the stock is just cheap at the moment.\n\n* **Valuation and Earnings:** Given the ongoing buybacks, insider enthusiasm, and strong fundamentals, my target price of around $17.40 based on a P/E of 15 and an EPS of $1.16 seems achievable for this stock before the end of the year. FLIC's annual report pegs the book value at $16.83/share which you can see in their SEC filing and I believe once the regional banking sector rebounds FLIC will get right back to $17+. \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFLIC\u2019s blend of strategic buybacks, insider confidence, and significant movement on small volume, alongside its solid financials and undervalued options, make it an intriguing prospect for those looking for a mix of safety and growth in the financial sector.\n\nBut bottom line: it's undervalued and the company has been around 100 years.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is for informational purposes only, not financial advice. Always do your own research or consult a professional.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 290 Shares\n* 10 \u2013 9/20 $10 C\n* 5 \u2013 12/20 $12.50 C",

They will need to refinance, but the terms will likely be onerous.\n* Liabilities exceed assets by 1.8B, so the company is basically at the mercy of the senior lenders\n* The writers' and actors' strikes did a number on box office revenue for at least two quarters - so far\n* Management has no qualms raising money through share issuance, which has diluted shareholders down the drain (\\~20X over 3 years).

Operating Income is different from EBIT, and therefore my intuitition tells me that using one or the other has consequences for the later valuation process with, for example, companies that have a significant amount of earnings from non-operating activities investments or credit lending.

Also assume all asset is worthless by the end so nothing to salvage. \n\nEg.

During the Subprime meltdown he did special deals with Goldman and BofA - as mentioned already with loans that converted to stock at a preset price or preferred shares or warrants that accomplish the same.

        "post_body": "I originally viewed TDM as a plantation Group with a healthcare arm. About 17 years ago, the healthcare segment only accounted for about 16% of the Group revenue. The Group plantation operations then was mainly in Malaysia and this accounted for a large part of the Group\u2019s revenue. \n\nThe Group decided to expand it plantations segment by venturing to Indonesia. It took several years to get this going such that the maiden revenue from the Indonesian plantation was only in 2013. By then  the Group had \u201c..earmarked that the growth of the plantation operations will be in Kalimantan.\u201d \n\nBut things began to go wrong with the Indonesian operations soon after. The losses and impairments got so bad that the Group announced its plans to sell the Indonesian assets in 2019.  By 2023 it was still trying to complete the sale of its Indonesian assets. \n\nIf not for the healthcare segment, which had grown to account for 56 % of the Group\u2019s revenue in 2023, TDM would be in a worse shape.\n\nMoral of the story? Beware of companies announcing expanding into foreign countries as the Malaysian experience may not always be transferable. \n\nGiven the poor plantation segment performance, the market took a dim view of the company despite a growing healthcare segment. I guess the market is still waiting for TDM to prove that it can recover from the Indonesian lesson. \n\nRefer to \u201cIs TDM a value trap?\u201d if you want to bet on its turnaround. \n\n[https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more](https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more)",

        "post_body": "(Downvote if you do not want to see this type of articles. Do not downvote because you do not agree with the article)\n\n**A Value Investor\u2019s Guide to Navigating Technology Disruption**\n\nBy Mark Iong\r \n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/value-investing-technology-stocks-s-curve-40230f6a?mod=djem\\_b\\_Weekly%20Barrons%20feed%20for%20last%2024%20hours\n\nTectonic shifts occur more frequently in technology than in other sectors, so investors need to be wary of tech companies that are approaching the mature stage of what is known as the S-curve.\r \n\nThis curve, shaped like the letter \u201cs,\u201d is a visual representation of the growth path that technology companies tend to follow. It begins with slow initial growth (the bottom of the \u201cs\u201d) then moves with rapid upward growth as adoption takes off, finally arriving at the plateau stage, at which businesses become increasingly commoditized, growth becomes saturated, and returns trend lower. Companies in the plateau stage of the S-curve often find it difficult to recapture their momentum, particularly in the tech sector, where megatrends tend to be irreversible. Consider the evolution of computer technology from mainframes to PCs and servers, to mobile and the cloud\u2014each development a paradigm shift that didn\u2019t reverse course and that rendered the previously used technology less favored and eventually obsolete. With artificial intelligence, a similar seismic shift is now under way.\r\n\nAs value investors, we naturally gravitate to the uppermost section of the S-curve. Quality companies often become undervalued by the market at this stage, providing the opportunity to buy at a significant discount relative to their long-term intrinsic value. But we need to be highly selective, identifying businesses that have the competitive moats and defensive characteristics that will extend the upward slope of the S-curve into the new technology frontier instead of entering the plateau stage.\r\n\nBy contrast, mature tech companies risk succumbing to the \u201cinnovator\u2019s dilemma,\u201d a term coined by the late academic and business consultant Clayton Christensen to describe how companies cling to their established markets and protect profit margins instead of focusing on innovations that might disrupt their core businesses but also open up new opportunities for growth. As new entrants exploit this complacency and carve out a niche in the market, legacy businesses eventually fall victim to a shrinking profit pool, as capital flows to new entrants that offer products with more power, efficiency, scalability, and affordability.\r\n\nWithout innovations to alter their weakening fundamental outlook, the old guard may see profits dwindle and their valuations deflate. It is a slow bleed, a value trap that lulls investors with seemingly cheap metrics but masks a bleak future. We feel it is important to avoid these long-term secular losers that might seem statistically cheap based on today\u2019s valuation. A company trading at a depressed price-to-earnings multiple, for example, could be \u201ccheap\u201d for a reason, reflecting a declining business where valuation could remain low indefinitely or worse, continue to compress.\r\n\nThere are several important traits we look for when evaluating maturing technology businesses. They need to be innovative with an eye toward the future, developing new products and services that can position them for the next paradigm shift. Management needs to be willing to disrupt themselves, even if doing so risks revenue and earnings losses in the near term. We witnessed several companies created in the early days of the internet, for instance, that successfully navigated their way into mobile computing in the 2010s and are now attempting to repeat the same playbook as they make strides in the AI era of the 2020s.\n\nPlatform companies are probably the best examples of businesses that are most adept at steering through disruptions. Such companies have an extensive ecosystem of first-party software and hardware products and third-party partners that rely on their platforms. Cloud computing exemplifies this dynamic today, where several players control the majority of the market and are essentially the gatekeepers for all things artificial intelligence and cloud computing. In technology subsectors such as semiconductors and enterprise software, we seek those firms with durable business models and robust product road maps that can serve as the foundational layers of the next megatrend.\r\n\nTechnology companies primed for long-term success understand that disruption is a marathon, not a sprint. Conversely, those that struggle to adapt and innovate are the ones most likely to stumble. Value investors who recognize this could be primed to take advantage of outperformance in the tech sector. \n\n============================\n\n&#x200B;",

Additionally, other insiders have not sold any shares over the past few years. I heavily weigh insider ownership whether they were paid for, awarded, or granted in lieu of payment.

Numora Holding Inc, comes in second at 2,946, 552 shares, then Vanguard at 2,825,335 million shares, and lastly Elliot Investment Management L.P., comes in at 1,550, 523 million shares. See all institutional ownership here, ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings))\r\n* Y**ou\u2019re probably wondering at this point, how does Defencath work, and what are the Projected vials to be sold?** Cormedix projects to sell 3.4 million vials on the inpatient side and over 37 million vials on the out-patient side. The growth potential is HUGE!\r\n* **With such volume you\u2019re probably wondering at this point how precisely does the product work\u2026** Well, Every Time a patient receives hemo-dialysis the catheter must be flushed with the Defencath solution before and after. That is approximately two vials per patient per visit with the average patient getting about 3 treatments per-week, out of 550,000 patients on hemodialysis.\r\n* Cormedix plans, and is on track to launch Defencath for out-patient setting on July 1, 2024.\r\n* Cormedix Plans on expanding its usage and application of Defencath to other populations that already have CVCs, like Oncology.\r\n* The current short interest as of 3/31/24 is 34 million dollars or approx. 8.2 million shares.\r\n* **Marketing Plan**: There are 5 major companies that control the out-patient setting, and two of them control 70% of the market. Remember, Out-patient is projected to sell appx. 37 million vials!\r\n* The Projected market impact of the stock is incredible, and understanding the product shows the extreme value it holds.\r\n* **Debt:** the company has NO debt.\r\n* **Market Exclusivity:** CRMD has 10.5 years market exclusivity because it's a qualified infectious diseases, and it's a new chemical entity. And it\u2019s intellectual property is extended until April 15, 2024. See ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/))\r\n* **WHY WILL CRMD EXPLODE SOONER THAN ANALYISTS EXPECTATIONS?**\r\n* The out-patient setting is dominated by 5 major out-patient facilities, and once it received it's NDA every medical Journal posted the NDA approval AND JOE, MENTIONED THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING TO BOTH IN-PATIENT AND OUT PATIENT FACILITIES AT March 12th Earnings Call \"March 12, 2024 \"Joe Todisco, CorMedix CEO, commented, \u201cI am excited about the Company\u2019s recent progress as we have scaled up activity ahead of our commercial launch in April. **We have received significant inbound interest from both inpatient facilities as well as outpatient dialysis providers with respect to DefenCath, and we are actively engaged in customer discussions in both settings of care**\" ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:\\~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)))\r\n* **Competition:** There is no Drug on the market that prevents CRBIs the way Cormedix does and there is absolutely no competition.\r\n* The CTXR guys will say we\u2019re competition but we\u2019re not. Mino-lock salvages an already infected Catheter. It\u2019s a reactive medicine opposed to Defencath which is Preventative.\r\n   * The preventative application allows for such high sales values in such an exclusive market.\r\n* **CREDIT TO Fretwizard125,** \u201cGood post and summary of what\u2019s in play here. I\u2019ve been in CRMD since 2018 and Have been accumulating. Have a multi-hundred thousand dollar position and am waiting for this to explode. With TDAPA we could see 70-80% market penetration really quickly, (1-2 years).\r\n   * The Wholesale Acquisition Price FROM CRMD and approved by CMS is $250/vial. They will likely offer discounts to the providers to adopt and recognize revenue too. But even with a 70% discount for a vial potential revenue is insane.\r\n   * Quick math $75/vial x20,000,000 vials (50% penetration) =$1.5b. Yes billion, with a B.\r\n   * This does not include other indications they are trying to expand into including oncology and TPN. Oncology market is 1.5x the size of hemodialysis. This is a long term hold with literally the most perfect commercialization setup I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d--- Credit to Fretwizard 125\r\n* Projected Price: Low $9.00 per share, medium is $12.00 per share; high of $19.00 per share within the next year. I believe we\u2019re going to hit the 9s in july and potentially hit 20s before December.\r\n* **TLDR:** Cormedix(CRMD) Is Deep Value. It hit\u2019s all of the marks. CRMD is poised for huge growth over the next year, reaching over a billion sales. The market is unique, and they\u2019re going to be the standard of care. The stock is primed to explode at any day. I believe the stock will be at least 25$ per share by March 2025 if not $35-$40 per share. 5 Major companies control 100% of the out-patient market. They\u2019ll be announcing contracts in the coming weeks. I think we can hit 12$ before the out-patient launch in July, that\u2019s my opinion.\r\n* **All RISK IS ELIMINATED!**\r\n* **POSITION:**\r\n   * 50 call contracts $6 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K Exp. June 21\r\n   * 50 call Contracts $7 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K exp June 21\r\n   * 3750 Shares average $4.15. (have a little bit of higher average because of options trading throughout the past 3 years.)",

        "post_body": "Hello,\n\nI wrote up an article that provides a framework for evaluating and comparing quality compounders like Hershey using key metrics and analyzing long-term trends in the financials of the business. By interpreting financial data visually in the key areas outlined below, we can more easily identify businesses with the potential for sustained growth and value creation over the long term.\n\n* Price and Volatility: Understand the risk profile and market perception of a company\n* Income Statement and Balance Sheet: Understand the company's earnings, assets, and financial health.\n* Valuation: Assess the value of a company relative to its peers and industry.\n* Return of Value: Explore a company's strategy for returning value to shareholders.\n* Industry Comparison: Benchmark a company against its direct competitors. \n\n [How Hershey Can Be Your Golden Ticket for Evaluating Investment Opportunities](https://quartest.substack.com/p/how-hershey-can-be-your-golden-ticket-90b)\n\nI have been developing this financial framework for analyzing stocks for quite some time now and thought you all might be interested in it. I would also greatly appreciate your feedback on the analysis and my writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR Summary of my Hershey Analysis:\n\nHershey's consistent revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth have historically warranted a premium valuation to the market. The financial strength and resilience of the business have consistently placed Hershey as a top performing in the consumer staples sector. These returns have been well justified, as Hershey has continually demonstrated efficient uses capital, as evidenced by its high return on invested capital, equity, and assets. Its attractive return strategy, including dividend payouts and share buybacks, have provided a sound value return for shareholders.  \nHowever, Hershey has recently been faced with perceived challenges in maintaining sustainable earnings growth in an inflationary environment with skyrocketing cocoa prices and tough competition from snacking rivals. While Hershey's five-year historical EPS growth lags behind some competitors and has recently slowed, its valuation has potentially come down to reasonable levels given the quality of the business and its strong cash flow generation. Nevertheless, Hershey's ability to navigate external factors including  market dynamics and further cost fluctuations in its inputs, will be crucial to the company's long-term success.\n\n",

The more you learn about it, the clearer it becomes that active investing isn't the best strategy for the majority. Instead, retail investors should focus on passive investing through diversified ETFs, understanding risks, diversification, and proper portfolio or asset allocation. Most importantly, they should get to know their own investor behavior.\n\nUnderstanding one's risk tolerance and creating a long-term, sustainable investment strategy that one can live with is crucial. For those still keen on learning about stock picking, it might be wise to limit this to about 5% of the portfolio. This can help mitigate the risk of capital loss while still allowing for significant learning outcomes in comparison to their broader market portfolio.\n\nI emphasize passive investment because there is strong empirical evidence showing that the market outperforms 80-95% of institutional investors after fees over any 10-year rolling period.

        "post_date": "2024-04-22T08:03:02",
        "post_body": "This week, I feel compelled to acquaint those unfamiliar with Benjamin Graham, the cornerstone figure of value investing. \n\nRegarded as the \u201cFather\u201d of this discipline, his seminal works, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, serve as indispensable guides for investors. Graham\u2019s principles laid the groundwork for the legends of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and continue to inspire legions of aspiring investors.\n\n>  \u201cThe intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\u201d  - Benjamin Graham\n\n# The Teachings of Benjamin Graham\nGraham imparted numerous invaluable lessons, but today, I wish to highlight three that I consider pivotal for enhancing one\u2019s investment acumen:\n\n## 1. Invest in the company, not the share price\nWhen we purchase just one stock of a listed company, it is no different from buying the entire business. That one share gives us ownership rights of the company, including a proportionate share of the company\u2019s profits. So we are NOT buying a share but rather a company.\n\nIt may seem like I am stating the obvious. Yet, even today, people trade stocks because of their volatility rather than the underlying fundamentals of that business, and even \u201cinvestors\u201d quickly overlook the basics of a company because they don\u2019t want to miss out on the latest trend.\n\nWhile there are stories of success trading stock and people retiring early because of  \u201cthe next big thing,\u201d there are far more stories of going broke due to the same strategies. Unfortunately, those stories are seldom in the media, posted on social media or spoken about over the dinner table.\n\nIf we want to be successful investors, we must understand the company we are buying, how it generates revenue, the costs to run it, and the risks involved. The more we know, the more confident we will be when we invest, and although that doesn\u2019t guarantee success, it dramatically improves it.\n\n## 2. Invest at less than it is worth.\nGraham, being an investor during the Great Depression, was always acutely aware of the risks of investing in the stock market and how easily fortunes could be lost. Therefore, he believed in investing with a Margin of Safety, which means buying shares in a company at a discount to its true worth or intrinsic value.\n\nIn Investing Chronicles above, we discussed the historical average P/E of the S&P 500, which is around 20.5, meaning that, on average, the price of the S&P 500 is roughly 20x the combined earnings of its constituents. If we assume this is the fair value of the index, then whenever the index is trading below 20x earnings, we have a margin of safety. The lower the P/E, the greater the margin of safety.\n\nSimilarly, for a company, once we have analysed the business and its economic drivers, we should be in a decent position to derive an estimate of its intrinsic value. If we believe the company to be worth $100 million and the market currently values it at $150 million, why would we purchase shares?\n\nHowever, the opportunity is evident if that company has a current value (market cap) of $75 million. More importantly, buying it at $75 million provides us with a safety net because our calculations might be off (almost guaranteed they are), and the company\u2019s actual value could be $80 million. Of course, the actual value could be $120 million, but you get the point!\n\n## 3. Let the Market Come to You\nBesides \u201cMargin of Safety\u201d, Graham is also famous for coining the term \u201cMr Market\u201d, referring to the bipolar nature of the stock market.\n\nIn the stock exchange, as with all things involving human beings, emotions get involved, and one could argue that when money is involved, we get highly emotional. The higher the emotional charge, the higher the capacity to act irrationally.\n\nEuphoria will likely occur when share prices appreciate and money is made. Market participants throw caution to the wind during these times, feeling nothing can go wrong. As a result, investors overpay for assets. We can see this currently, at least in my opinion, as certain tech stocks are valued as though the stars have aligned.\n\nOf course, the opposite is true too, when fear takes grip. During these times, irrational, pessimistic market participants convince themselves that they will lose all their money and sell while running for the hills, screaming, \u201cThe sky is falling\u201d. During these times, valuations can plummet to illogical lows.\n\nOur goal is to remove our emotions when investing.\n\nInvesting in the long term is a fantastic strategy because it allows us to ignore short-term market noise and fluctuations, especially if we understand what we have bought. We are in a hugely advantageous position to take advantage of Mr Market, buying when fear is at its peak and selling to the overzealous buyer.\n\n# Summary\nSo be more like the Father of Investing:\n\n- Know what you are buying,\n- Know what it is worth, and\n- Only buy it when you can get a substantial discount.\n\nIf you can master the above, you are well on your way to being better than most.\n\nHope you enjoyed this.

But even if he did and I\u2019m not aware, you also have to take the context of the P/E into account\u2026.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked at it but let\u2019s say you are correct about historic P/E being at 20x. Okay. But that was before companies were buying back shares (and retiring those shares) like crazy. That means there are less shares of quality companies to go around. While in a vacuum the P/E should not change with shares bought back, you aren\u2019t considering the DEMAND for those shares staying the same or even increasing. There are plenty of research papers arguing that due to the prevalence of share buybacks we may be entering a world where higher P/Es are standard, at least for a while. \n\nAlso, I would say that China\u2019s current low P/E is NO indication of \u201ccheapness\u201d but rather of lack of quality and higher risk.",

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That\u2019s almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.\n\n. . . . . . \n\nA few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make\u2014or, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.\r  \n\r  \nHuang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren\u2019t the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well\u2014or better\u2014than Nvidia.\n\n. . . . . \n\nNvidia\u2019s rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won\u2019t be winner-take-all. It isn\u2019t game over. It\u2019s game on.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia\u2019s most obvious challengers are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\n\n. . . . . . . ",

This stock is 100% in oversold territory. \n\nThe North Face brand is huge in Europe and will only grow larger in the US given they are establishing a new commercial organization and regional platform in Americas region, replicating the strategy used in the EMEA which grew the north face. Not only does it have significant market share in outdoors, climbing, it only has a growing market share in street fashion and casualwear, and the inner-city kids in europe love them. Their parkas and puffers are also deeply embedded in europe rap/drill/grime culture.\n\nHere's a recent quote from Bracken Darrell :   \nWe have a team working on about five different strategies such that they (The North Face) are relevant 365 days a year, at least outdoors, not just when you're not on the mountain in winter. We tend to skew more males than females, so we have ample opportunities for women.\n\nTNF growing   \nVans bottoming and turning back to growth    \nSupreme bottoming   \nTimberlands bottoming",

If you're looking for countries with value, look for countries not actively at war. It seems like China is doing a lot to re-attract foreign capital, and it's unlikely that the country invades Taiwan any time soon. European markets are also pretty flat right now.

Add on the current conflict and split opinions the impact of GLP-1s on their business, they may struggle for some time.\n\nRegarding interest rates, their products are largely financed when purchased. The selling price in the US is about 2-2.5x that OUS. Payback periods are quick based on an ASP of $130k but high rates are still deterring purchases. Lenders have also been slower in lending. INMDs clientele are also not wealthy. Average income of $60k. They are sensitive to higher interest rates.\n\nGeopolitical risk will be there for some time but the US being right off the coast should keep things from getting out of control. All 3 of INMDs primary manufacturers (outsourced) are in Israel. They have a buffer from the borders but Israel is so small that it may not matter much if things do escalate. GLP-1s in my view are not an issue. Overall, it should boost demand.\n\nLaser-based products have an installed base of 40-50k in the US. IMND was at around 7.5k at the end of 2022. INMDs products do the same things as lasers (for what they market them for), but better. They are finding new indications (ENT, Ophthalmology, Women's and Men's health) to increase their TAM and have a pile of cash they will have to do something with. All of this with strong IP protection through this decade and likely into the 2030s. Long-term, I think they recover just fine. Short-term may be ugly though.",

A Munger quote I like is one where he says that if someone were to approach him about a company with a great future but doesn\u2019t have a track record, he will send the person on his way. \n\nI screen for quality first, then put the stocks on a watchlist and wait until they become cheaper to own.\n\nBy quality I look for consistency of results and return on equity. Specifically, past five year of revenue and eps each year better than the previous year. And in the last 5 years, roe as a minimum of 10.

Otherwise, if your intention is to invest with a long time horizon (5+ years), I\u2019d strongly recommend the majority of qyour portfolio being a couple broad, low-cost index funds \u2014 VOO is a terrific choice.\n\nYou can explore the various options for ETFs using a tool like [this fund screener](https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-screener).\n\nIf picking stocks, you should be able to explain your thesis to someone. You should also be aware of the company\u2019s fundamentals. This takes time and effort, but is essential. I would strongly recommend listening to earnings calls: They provide important insights into a company and its leadership. The Quartr app is a great tool for this.\n\nEDIT: I see you invested in some of these companies because they pay a dividend. Might be worth reading up on the considerations.

If that doesn't appeal to you, just go with something straightforward like VTI or VOO. Try to keep individual stock picking to no more than 5% of your total investments.\n\nAs a beginner, it's easy to make expensive mistakes and challenging to consistently outperform the market over the long term. Don't take my word for it; there's strong evidence showing that simply holding onto market indices beats 80-95% of managed mutual funds over a decade, and the results are even more pronounced over longer periods.\n\nAt this stage, you likely don't have the expertise needed to effectively manage the risks associated with picking stocks. It's better to grow your wealth passively and maybe experiment with a small portion of your portfolio to get a feel for the market. This way, you minimize potential losses, which saves more of your capital for investing once you've mastered the basics and developed a solid strategy.\n\nPicking individual stocks is tough. It involves a deep dive into financial reports, understanding business models, analyzing fundamentals, forecasting growth, and estimating the true value of a company. This process requires a lot of reading, a solid grasp of financial principles, disciplined effort, and considerable time.

PYPL etc..\n\nHowever they\u2019re an up and coming growth stock which I believe is undervalued based out of Calgary, AB. \n\nThey currently have a market cap of 312M, trading at 4.30/share.\n\nThey\u2019re expected to continue to grow at >30% CAGR for the next few years. - TD Cowen Analyst\n\nThey sold their first company (BW Technologies) to HoneyWell in 2006.\n\nThey got back to work in the Gas Detection Industry and have now developed a product that far exceeds all their peers. They\u2019ve started gaining name recognition AND with new caveat to the business\u2026 They now offer SaaS paired with their hardware. This is creating extremely sticky returning sales with 120% Net Retention as clients love the services being offered.\n\nThey have solid financials, great growth and a great product.\n\nInsider Ownership is sitting around 30%, Institutional ownership is also high.\n\nI do own shares, however am looking to hear what you guys think.\n\nWith interest rates expected to decline over the next few years and my expectations that money will rotate into growth, I see a great opportunity for this company to thrive and potentially be acquired for a good premium.\n\nCheers!",

For example, if you decide to invest in a company that has ok earnings now but is expected to grow by an average of 20% per year for the next 3 years that that might be considered a value investing strategy assuming it hasn't been priced in already. \n\nThe market is efficient, and most news about the present and future is factored into the price almost immediately. The times when innefciencies usually exist is during uncertainty. In uncertain times,  future information is in limbo, and investors tend to react negatively to the news. wich typically drags the price of a stock down and creates temporary undervaluation. The undervsluation could be warranted, or it might just be an overreaction to capitalize on. \n\nThe other time undervaluations exists is due to the difficulty of making accurate future predictions about a company. The larger the growth variance, the more inaccurate the prediction. But always remember growth and value are two sides of the same coin.\n\nI'd read some Peter lynch books as a beginning to merge the ideas of growth and value together. It is the riskier side of value investing. But, even Warren Buffet recognizes that value and growth are related.\n\nRemember, the DCF valuation model is based on growth, earnings, and the discount rate used.

Think of it as high earnings/cashflow predictability and low earnings/cashflow predictability.\n\n Take a look at PepsiCo, I'd argue that investing in PepsiCo today isn't value investing because the growth is too low to justify its current valuation. However, its earnings are highly predictable. If for an immaterial reason the value of PepsiCo contracts, perhaps a macro event, or Wallstreet investing elsewhere, then it may easily become a value investing opportunity when purchased at the right price. \n\nNow, take a look at Microsoft/Apple. I'd argue that many times in the last 10 years, these have been value picks (perhaps less so today). High multiples for a good while, but justified by reasonable growth and reasonable short-term (10 years) earnings predictability.\n\nNow look at Nvidia, very rapid growth, very high multiples, very low earnings predictability. I have no clue what Nvidia's cash flows will be in 4 years. How can I estimate the company's value when I can't reasonably estimate their cash flows. Are they going to double this year like they did last year? Are they going to double again in 2025? Is the AI push going to drive sales in perpetuity, or will there be enterprise upgrade cycles? I have no idea, and even industry veterans should be cautious when companies grow this quickly.\n\nLook at Spotify, lots of topline growth, bottomline inches towards profitability, and a market dominating product. How can we, with reasonable accuracy, estimate margins and cash flows for a company that has never turned a profit. In 5 years, will their operating margin be closer to 15% or 0%. We've never seen them earn a profit, so predicting how profitable they can be is very difficult.\n\nNow look at Ford, a PE of ~5.7. But compare their operating cash flow growth today vs. 10 years ago, then look at how much of their cash flow from all sources they have reinvested in the company over the last 10 years. You'll find that they need to reinvest nearly all of their cash flow just to run in place. Not value, and unlikely to become a value pick.",

Growth is not a guarantee, so it's technically requires you to understand the industry well to make hypothesis on technical moat, network effect etc. Value investing from Ben Graham was originally \"cigar butt\" investing which meant finding old companies whose book value was higher than the current market cap of the company. Berkshire Hathway was originally a failing textile company in Massachusetts when Buffet bought it. \n\n\"Value investing\" is kind of hand in hand with Buffets ascension, as before him it was relatively small. As such the interest in value investing has expanded as people like Munger or Monesh Pabrai entered the field. These guys were more ideas driven and companies like Berk started buying companies like Apple, which acts as both a value and growth stock. So there is a venn diagram of companies that satisfy both requirements. \n\nBut to give a clear cut example - NVDA or AMZN only appeal to growth investors. Their P/E multiples quite literally never fall low enough for someone like Buffet to invest as their price is only justified by constant growth. A company like Pepsi on the other hand, is way pass growth phase. Microsoft is probably your best example of a sweet spot. \n\nHow well each category does is pretty sensitive to interest rates, the economy, and market sentiment. If a recession hits, value stocks will outperform growth stocks.

Soon a cascade of laughing emojis filled the screen.\n\n=================================================================\n\nArticle Link: \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/business/retail/nike-reverse-innovation-stalls-rivals-gain-c3ed8e63?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos7\n\nPreview Link: [https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ca416x/wsj\\_21april\\_2024\\_nike\\_reverses\\_course\\_as/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ca416x/wsj_21april_2024_nike_reverses_course_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n  \n=================================================================  \nQuotes:\n\nSince the pandemic, Nike has lost ground in its critical running category while it focused on pumping out old hits and preparing for an e-commerce revolution that never came. The moves, current and former employees say, have eroded a culture of innovation and edginess that made Nike one of the world\u2019s best-known brands.\n\n. . . \n\nAmong the reversals: As Covid raged and more shopping moved online, Nike cut ties with longtime retail partners such as DSW and Urban Outfitters and tried selling more merchandise directly to consumers. It is now asking some of those stores for help clearing out its overstuffed shelves and warehouses.\n\n. . .\n\nThe strategic missteps have animated a debate inside the company about its identity. In its zeal to boost digital sales, some current and former employees say, Nike veered from its roots as a maker of cutting-edge footwear for serious athletes. It has opened itself to competition from newcomers such as On and Hoka, which have borrowed from the playbook that fueled Nike\u2019s rise\u2014including focusing on sport over lifestyle, and taking risks on innovation.\r  \n\r  \nNike\u2019s once torrid growth has stalled. Sales for the quarter ended Feb. 29 were flat compared with a year earlier, and shares in the company have declined 24% over the past year, compared with a 19% gain in the S&P 500.  \n\n. . . \n\nOne of the casualties of Donahoe\u2019s 2020 transformation was a multibillion-dollar operation dedicated to developing footwear sold for under $100. The company deprioritized more-affordable footwear that usually sold to the sales partners that Nike was leaving behind. The move left Nike skewed toward higher-priced shoes.\r  \n\r  \nThe first evidence of cracks in Nike\u2019s new approach appeared early last year when Foot Locker Chief Executive Mary Dillon said during an earnings call the brand had reversed course and was sending the retailer a wider assortment of Nike products. By the summer, Macy\u2019s and DSW were saying the same thing.\n\n. . . .\n\nOften quoting Knight, the Nike co-founder, former employees said the principle always was to first capture the market for hard-core athletes with innovative performance gear, and the casual consumer would follow.\r  \n\r  \nIn early February, Hoka owner Deckers Outdoor tapped Nike alums to take over both the parent company and the shoe brand. Hoka had $1.4 billion in sales for the year through March 2023, compared with about $352 million three years earlier.  \n\n. . .\n\nCurrent and former Nike executives believe the future of the company is in its app ecosystem, like the Nike Training and Running Club or its SNKRS app, and the data it can harness from them to help design and sell products. Inside the company, leaders have long tried to draw comparisons to Apple when talking about Nike\u2019s innovation and design culture.\n\n. . .\n\nAs part of its accelerated focus on digital sales, Nike hired about 3,500 people to join what the company calls its global technology group, which includes consumer insights and data analytics. Executives at the time said they were investing in \u201cdemand sensing,\u201d \u201cinsight gathering\u201d and a new inventory system. \r  \n\r  \nFormer Nike employees with knowledge of the consumer insights strategy said executives misinterpreted the data in ways that overestimated demand for retro franchises. \n\n. . . \n\nAt the Olympics preview event this month, the company took over the historic Palais Brongniart in central Paris with a three-day event to unveil its new Air line. Guests wandered through a museum-like, conveyor-belt installation highlighting Nike\u2019s product evolutions and research and development programs. Athletes including runners Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Eliud Kipchoge modeled the new gear. Retired tennis great Serena Williams narrated the company\u2019s lavish introduction video before appearing on stage. \r  \n\r  \nOutside, 30-foot orange statues of Nike-sponsored athletes including LeBron James, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Victor Wembanyama stood guard. \n\n. . .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

You win 60% of the time, lose 40% of the time, net result is you win 20% of the time and in each bet you won you earned a 5% profit. So overall you gained (20% of your bets won) \\* (5% profit per win) = 1% profit for your entire portfolio for that quarter. Compounding over four quarters per year you get around 4.1%, which isn't amazing especially considering this is a high turnover strategy.\n\nYou can fiddle around with the 60% number and the 5% SL/TP sizing, but what you'll find out is that either the insider trading signal has to be really really accurate or you have to take very big SL/TP bets (higher volatility) in order to beat the market on average.",

Drugs - They have a lot of drugs coming off patent and are going to have to replace them with ones in their pipeline.\n\n2. Acquisitions - They made several big acquisitions with the Covid cash to address the drugs coming off patent. Those acquisitions used up pretty much all the Covid cash and almost doubled their long term debt load. If they get some drugs approved from those acquisitions they'll be in a better place moving forward, if not they're in trouble.\n\n3. Costs - Looking at their numbers you would expect the revenue from Covid to come down, but what is concerning is that their costs have not come down at all. Those elevated costs and decreased revenue numbers are destroying their margins.\n\n4. Capital Management (my concern) - They had plenty of cash from Covid, but used all of it on big, maybe overpriced, acquisitions. Not one penny went to capital returns for shareholders. Fully diluted share count is exactly the same as it was two years ago, and the dividend was increased by a miniscule amount. I would've liked to see them reward shareholders a little bit more. However I do understand the patent cliff coming up so maybe they made the right decision on capital allocation. I guess we'll have to wait and see.",

Not exponentially though, but they\u2019ll still grow.\n\nBuT The PaTenT eXpiRaTiOns\u2026\n\nYES, I KNOW! And that\u2019s why Albert has been focused on the [pipeline](https://www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline) so much. We had a record number of approvals last year, but the stupid Street remained focused on Covid this and Covid that.\n\nThe next catalysts are going to be the upcoming ER on May 1st and updates about danuglipron. A successful danu update will send us to the moon. A sh*tty one, well\u2026\n\nOh, and Jim Cramer said he doesn\u2019t recommend buying Pfizer shares, a couple of days ago. Always inverse Cramer, my friends. Always. (And Cathie Wood. She bought more Tesla at $200 in early February \ud83d\udc80)",
