I'll admit, its not a buffet stock at all, but it does seem to have a good value provided the potential I see with what they're doing.\n\n04/29/2024  \nAMD: \\~250B market cap  \nNvidia > 2.2T market cap  \nIntel: \\~ 130B market cap  \nTSMC \\~620B market cap  \nSamsung \\~ 310B market cap  \nIf I'm going to buy one of these companies with the most upside over 5-10 years, I'm struggling to see how intel isnt a strong contender given the current price. If Pat executes on his plan and becomes number 2 behind TSMC thats at least 2x upside and probably more. Hard to see a world where if Intel returns to growth, its not at least valued similarly to AMD.\n\nIm encouraged by the major increase in R&D spending.  This is the pain of their missteps. Intel is partly in the situation its in because previous CEO's neglected EUV and other technological advances to preserve margins. Now, Intel will be the first to rollout High NA EUV. Theyre going to be the first to do backside power delivery. Theyre focusing heavily on being the innovator they once were before an MBA took over as CEO (as opposed to an engineer like Pat).\n\nI know there are many other metrics to look at other than market cap. Revenue has been declining, earnings have been declining, it seems as if everything will continue downward but I doubt this trend will continue much longer.  At the current price, it looks like there is at least a reasonable expectation of preserving your investment and a solid chance at large upside if Pat executes and I might add... theyve been executing so far on their plan. The sales/revenue/earnings just havent come yet. Maybe it never will, but I think its a good bet.\n\nAll this being said, I would love to see what others are thinking about and the metrics they care about when evaluating this sector. I think that the chip industry is going to be one of the most important of the next 50 years.  I'm still learning and will also be buying the fidelity select semiconductor mutual fund if there is ever a broad downturn. ",

                "comment_body": "There is an average of like, 3-4 posts a week about intel, so I'll just copy paste a previous answer \n\n  \nIntel is a play on the growth in demand for CPUs in the near future. Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",

                "comment_body": "I bought Intel at 48 couple years ago and sold it at 48 this year right before earnings when it dropped significantly. \n\nI sold because after getting to know the industry there were a couple things that bothered me.\n\n1. I thought AMD and Intel always had been kinda a 50/50 player in both CPUs for laptop, desktop and datacenter. \n\nHuge mistake cause AMD used to have nothing and Intel used to own the market. AMD really got out of the bottle a couple years ago and Intel will never be able to crush them so badly again that AMD can't get into the market like they used to. \n\nSo going forward, they will have to share more of that market with AMD and have lower margins.\n\n2. x86 architecture. I thought this was also a part of their moat. Them and AMD are the only ones who can technically make these CPUs and therefore I thought they wouldn't have additional competition. Then Apple came with their M1 ARM based  chip and made MacOS be able to run on it. Not much later I see Windows slowly being able to run on ARM as well. \n\nSo now, suddenly you see more competition for the laptop, desktop and soon datacenter CPU space as well beside from just AMD. I wouldnt be surprised if Nvidia also goes after some market there. Qualcomm already trying to do it. \n\nSo Intel went from having basically zero competition in the CPU space to full on competition (which is still increasing). Nvidia being a 2 trillion dollar company now (compared to a maybe 10% of that when I invested in Intel) gives them access to raise capital extremely easy too...  \n\nI dont know how much cloud still needs x86 architecture, maybe still for a couple years, but im not betting on it.\n\n3. GPU wise Intel is years away from coming anywhere close to Nvidia and AMD. Especially in the datacenter GPU. Nvidia has been working on this for the last 10-15 years and AMD for quite a while as well while Intel just recently started a couple years ago. Will be years before they launch anything decent here.\n\nThen there is Mobileye. I just don't know about this one. I thought they were gonna spin off more shares at a 50bn valuation 2 years ago but they were too slow. Its hard to see whether Mobileye will be competitive enough or not with other big companies in the self driving industry..\n\nThe only good thing is are the investments in foundry. The US will invest a lot in it but TSMC and Samsung will also build foundries in the US. Nothing is certain here for Intel although I think some companies will like to use both TSMC and Intel to diversify supply chains.. \n\nI'm not touching the stock anymore for the foreseeable future.",

For the sake of brevity, I'm going to ignore CPU and GPU which I believe are key to Intel's potential success. Rather I'm going to write about the Fab which has been what kept me away from the company.\n\nThe main problem with the semiconductor industry is you're either ahead and everyone uses you or you're behind and you start to bleed customers. It's not like Coke and Pepsi where it's down to consumer preference there is typically an objectively better technology that can be mathematically quantified. \n\nFurthermore, new semiconductor foundries are extremely expensive and have very high fixed costs. If these foundries don't run with significant volumes then expect them to burn cash. \n\nTSMC has in recent times had the best process technology and companies like Apple, AMD, and Nvidia collaborate with TSMC to share R&D costs and in exchange for early access to TSMC's new process technology (Node). This is a big benefit for these companies because it leads to more efficient better performance products thus leading to higher sales and more collaboration with TSMC. Naturally, this is sort of a self-perpetuating cycle where TSMC benefits from other companies' R&D.\n\nFor these reasons, the semiconductor industry is sort of naturally monopolistic. \n\nTo overcome this Intel needs to build multiple billion-dollar fabs. Catch up with TSMC on process technology and build strong relationships/tools so other customers can manufacture at Intel Foundry services. Even if this is accomplished they need to stay in the lead against a TSMC which will no doubt see this as an existential threat to themselves and possibly even their country. All of this is extremely expensive and carries major risks to the company.\n\nFurthermore, what happens if there's a glut of supply from the semiconductor fabs? After all Global Foundries Samsung and TSMC are all building fabs. Do we really need all this increased capacity? If Intel builds these hugely expensive bleeding edge fabs and there's a recession or semiconductor glut then I'd imagine the fabs will quickly start burning cash. Even if Intel has the best process technology.\n\nIt would be one thing if Intel was still a CPU monopoly but those days gave sailed. It just appears to me that they're pursuing this strategy from a position of weakness and I fear it won't end well. \n\nThe irony is this strategy was tried before by AMD with global foundries and it almost bankrupted them. Intel's gambit seems similar and it has me worried that the result will be the same. That said it will be brilliant if they pull it off.",

Servers can switch because they run a handful of programs, but pretty much everywhere else has major issues. Gamers will never be able to switch, as the complexities of programming a videogame in arm is very different, and every single game on steam only supports x86. \n\nx86 isn't really gonna grow, but that's because it's already the default.

I for a while now have thought a lot of their content is sh**, even when Iger was in charge.  Not saying it's not a good buy, but just not for me\n2. I won't buy a company if I don't like their ceo.  And in general I want to really think the ceo is smart, talented and capable. One of my favorite CEO's right now i Satya Nadella. Elon Musk is a great example of a CEO I don't like.  He's brilliant but an a** hole and way to mercurial for me.  Even if TSLA started trading at a great price, I'd pass.  Cyber Truck epitomizes my greatest concern with someone like Elon.  \n3. I won't buy \"Cigar butt\" plays or companies.  I feel like the downside is often underplayed (zero gains or a minor loss) and the best upside is often doubling your money and then selling.  Then you have to find another company and repeat.  Paramount is a company that comes to mind that I passed on for this reason.  I'd rather buy a company I can hold for the long run if it does well.  \n4. I won't buy the most current hype stock. Right now Nvidia.  2021 was Bored Apes lmao and before that TSLA.  It's not that these are always bad plays but I want to avoid FOMO causing a loss.  There are plenty of opportunities out there imo.  When Nvidia is everywhere the chance of it being a good price isn't great.\n5. Certain business I avoid with no exception.  Car companies, commercial airline, Pharma/bio tech, tobacco and clothing retail come to mind.  A good stock right now that represents this is CROX.  It might be a great buy.. or it's just a fad.  I'd rather buy something a bit more certain. I'm starting to think all brick and mortar type stores should go here (kohls is the new BBBY change my mind).  What others would you all add to this?\n6. I won't invest in Chinese companies.  I'd also add any country that is extremely corrupt, unstable, etc. \nAlibaba is peak for me on this one.  In general I think an Authoritarian rule is too much of a threat to make up for this risk honestly.  I passed on Alibaba this whole time and so far so good.  Will continue to pass on it and all Chinese companies.\n7. I won't invest in companies with questionable moats.  I think Paypal comes to mind right now.  Is it a good price? Yes.  Do the numbers look good.  Also yes.  Does the moat look good? No.  20 years ago sending money was hard.   Preventing and managing fraud especially was hard.  With the advent of the smart phones came reliable 2 factor authentication. That and ai (formerly known as machine learning lmao) has massively cut down fraud on these platforms (meaning it's an easier business to create and not lose a shit ton).  Additionally all active banks moved into the internet age making sending money a hell of a lot easier.  Google and Apple are positioned extremely well to compete and I believe it will definitely hurt Paypal over the next decade. Both also have a shit ton of cash which is nice when you are involved in the world of money and credit.\n8.   I won't buy a stock that I can't see myself still owning 10 years from now.To be clear, I not saying I will hold stuff for 10 years.  I'm just saying that's the long term timeline I want to be thinking on.  A great business should continue to do well for the next decade at least... If it's in situation where that's a concern, you might want to look at something else\n9. No companies that are heavy handed on the politics.  It's a distraction, it's exhausting and misses the point of a business.

        "post_date": "2024-04-28T18:25:49",
        "post_body": "Cooper-Standard, a leader and global suppliers of sealing systems and component, fuel and brake delivery, and fluid transfer systems was a pre-pandemic money tree cranking out over $8 EPS. During the pandemic, when global light vehicle production was cast into the depths of hell, multiple competitors within the space were forced to close shop; although $CPS remained afloat it did not come out unscathed. Instead, the stock plummeted into freefall, and was down over 90% from it's all-time high. But like my grandma says, when there is blood in the streets, buy real estate. And gentlemen, I have opened $CPS as my largest position and it's my 2024 best-performer pick. Let me explain why.\n\nDuring the pandemic, global light vehicle production volumes fell to a low of 77.6 million units in 2020. Mr. Fu Bingfeng, President of OICA, described the sharp downtrend as \"the worst crisis ever to impact the automotive industry.\" Due to being inherently dependent on light vehicle production, Cooper Standard's top line was obliterated. They went from an untouchable EPS and EBITDA monster to complete stagnation.\n\nWith production annihilated, it is no surprise that eight auto parts suppliers filed for bankruptcy between 2020 and 2021. While Cooper-Standard survived the chaos, revenues declined by over 35%, and shareholders experienced a 90% drop in share price. During the post-pandemic recovery, another major headwind emerged. The UAW strike once again halted light vehicle production for three of Cooper Standard's largest customers. Today, these obstacles have been successfully navigated, and the ascent to reclaim the throne has never been more clear.\n\nLight vehicle production is now on a tear for a multitude of reasons. First, the average age of a vehicle on the road is currently sitting at an all time high of 13.6 years. That coupled with the fact that current domestic auto-inventory sits at 1.4 months (meaning the current stock of automobiles could only supply 1.4 months of sales) creates a huge impetus to start cranking out vehicles. And vehicle production = $CPS profits. Better yet, the vehicle production numbers from Q1 2024 are significantly exceeding consensus predictions. In every month in 2024 to date, vehicle sales have been significantly higher than in 2023. In March alone, vehicle sales were more than 100,000 units greater in 2024 than in 2023.\n\nThis boom in vehicle production and sales has lifted all major automakers than have already reported 1Q earnings, as they continue to beat and raise guidance.\n\nAs far as the financials are concerned, $CPS revenue and adjusted EBITDA show a clear inflection point in 2021, and with leaner costs from restructuring, coupled with the vehicle production turnaround, $CPS is poised to head to the moon gentlemen. Despite the clear path forward, the stock continues to trade \\~85% lower than its ATH. A major reason for this was the conservative guidance set forth by management at the Q4 earnings call, but during the call, the CEO of the company himself said, \"*Clearly, our light vehicle production units and the guidance that we've used for '24, you can see there are -- continue to be a bit conservative, I guess, is how I would describe it.*\" Well, the numbers coming in so far for 24 are far from the conservative estimates put forth by management, and I expect a resounding beat will be the result at their Q1 call in two weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: As mentioned above, I have opened a position in $CPS and as always do your own DD.",

Since 2019, management had made cuts that have contributed $479 million to adjusted EBITDA. They have improved operating efficiencies with smaller fixed cost structure, have higher margins on EVs due to them requiring 20% more content per vehicle, and renegotiated contracts with customers.  In short, they\u2019re making more money on each car manufactured, we were just waiting for production to ramp up (which the Q1 vehicle sale numbers so far suggest has already started to happen.).  These sales numbers are approximating 2018 levels DESPITE interest rates remaining high, imagine what car sale volume will look like once rates are.\n\nThe debt is primarily long-term debt, which allows Cooper Standard to ride the tailwinds current in place within the automotive industry and pay back that debt as the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",

Tech change can see a shift in cost or benefit and first mover / scale advantage can be gone quickly, especially if the scale is based upon short lived investments that face a short obsolescence cycle and need replacement - like IT hardware.\n\nAt one time people thought there was no alternative to IBM.  Operational cost from scale is not a long term moat.  First mover is an advantage only if it blocks competitors out - which in history has been a geographic or network effect story.\n\nPeople don\u2019t switch from Apple ecosystem because of what they would lose.  Facebook has a similar network effect advantage.  Msft has high barriers to change because all the devs would need retraining to move away from Msft enterprise.  Google is at risk but there is an intersection of tools and monopoly that make it the gorilla you HAVE to work with.  All of these tech companies are actively working to leverage their strengths to defend their moats and make them stronger and integrate with AI.\n\nIs there anything similar wrt AWS?  Network effects?  Lots of investment on their customers side that would have to be redone?  An obvious pathway to staying ahead of the surprise innovation out of left field that takes out the scale advantage?\n\nI get the arguments on the shopping portal side, but that business has not been terribly profitable in history.  I don\u2019t see where the durable moat is wrt an industry (cloud compute) that is racing towards commodification with competition that can afford to sell cloud at a loss because of the benefit they get from integration with all of their other datasets and services.\n\nAny high margin business attracts competition.  Everyone races to innovate and in the process prices tend to crater.  Eventually it becomes a commodity market.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to prove you wrong, I\u2019m genuinely trying to understand this idea that Amazon has a durable moat.  Is it some sort of proprietary container code that can\u2019t be replicated?  Is there some specialized knowledge and an army of workers that would need retraining?  Is there a patent that gives Amazon a durable cost advantage?  Why would companies (cloud customers) be willing give their supplier strategic pricing power over their bottom line?  What is stopping a lower cost producer from taking share with better operational tech?\n\nI\u2019ve heard this idea that all the aws container code would have to be rewritten.  Why couldn\u2019t an LLM do that?\n\nWhat is preventing competition from taking business from Amazon?  What will prevent commodification?",

Amazon is a very misunderstood company and people underestimate the near-impossibility of penetrating their moat. \"If you can't see it, don't buy it\" is something I always use when discussing Amazon and Google. \n\nI'm 100% convinced they have broken economics/capitalism. Not in the sense that they're gonna collapse the system, no, in the sense that they have achieved such an immense size and expertise their moat in some core activities is literally impenetrable. That's cloud servers and same day delivery network for Amazon and Search/Android/YouTube for Google. \n\nThere is just no viable way for any possible competitor to challenge them because interest rates will never be 0% again. Amazon built a fully in-house logistical powerhouse only rivalled by the US military with free money for years while they hemmoraged cash. Now they are optimising for profit and you can see FCF just blowing though the roof.

Even thought these are some very clear big risks, I do believe the upside is quite big as well.\n\nThe upside:\nThe margin of safety is quite big, the company has 0 debt, and hold a cash pile of 800 million USD, which is almost two times larger than the companies market cap.\nThe PE is 1.5 - however, over the last year, with the addition of its new insurance and online market place units, growth has been over 30% per quarter, and they have began using the cash on hand to invest into buying similar companies around the southern Asian area.\nThe growth potential is there, with all of their three segments posting solid growth in the past year, and forecast for the next year being growth of over 20%\nROIC over the last two years has been 20%+, and it is likely to continue next year\nShare repushases have began, and with the huge amount of cash on hand, and extremely low PE.

                "comment_body": "Just to add to what others have said:\n\n1) it\u2019s so that you can evaluate the business on its own merits.  Financial engineering is a real thing, compare a property rental company where they can buy assets with either 100% cash or 10% cash and 90% debt - the debt holders only receive a fixed income while any profits above this go directly to the shareholders after taxes, which means the return on investment can be hugely affected by the debt levels.  Therefore the merits of the business itself can be distorted by debt.\n\n2) It gives a clearer picture on how much debt a company can repay.\n\n3) Debt can distort the apparent value of a company, especially when using an earnings multiple as a valuation technique (e.g. a PE ratio). There are a few different ways that this could cause an error in judgement here: a) say EBIT is $100 and interest $90 leaving a profit of $8 after tax (at 20%), if companies in this industry are usually valued at a PE of 15, then you might think that the company should be worth $120 ($8 x 15).  But what if the company only has a year or two left on its loans?   Then the value would be radically different.  b) Another scenario, using the same figures above, is what if the company is growing very rapidly?  Using the same multiple to value both the business and the debt would clearly be an error in valuation. i.e. if earnings before tax in the following year is $200, the year after that $400, and the year after that $800, and if the debt and interest rates have remained unchanged at  just $90 interest per year, then applying an earnings multiple to the after interest figure would probably under value the company.\n\n4) A company is made up of the business itself (the assets, working capital, staff etc) and how it is financed (capital structure).  Debt is very easy to place a value on and usually the balance sheet figure is sufficient, though there can be exceptions that I won\u2019t get into.  So why complicate your evaluation of a business when you can simply deduct the debt at the end of your evaluation?  Having debt in the evaluation complicates things unnecessarily.  Again, there are exceptions, especially if the company has either significant debt - where a closer examination of the cash flows would be required, or very little debt - could be ignored for simplicity purposes.",

Similarly, if the rate on your debt is better than the price you pay for the acquired company, so long as it doesn't stretch you on leverage or coverage, it is also accretive to grow through acquisition.\n\n'Recapitalize' isn't an inherently dirty word. Look at a company like Transdigm. They have routinely recapitalized, particularly taking on debt to fund acquisitions, and like to run ~5x leverage. It has worked for them for decades, and they are not the only company to employ a similar strategy. When it comes to capital allocation, the answer is always 'it depends'.",

With BHP's recent bid being rejected and the pe firm Elliot Management announcing a billion-dollar stake in the company, it seems likely that the stock is set to run with a future offer having to be significantly more than the initial bid. However, there are still some uncertainties, particularly regarding the potential need for Anglo American to spin off significant portions of the company. Even at $16.40, the shares still appear undervalued to me given an imminent sale. I'm curious to hear if anyone else has any thoughts on this.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/activist-investor-elliott-builds-1-bln-anglo-american-stake-bloomberg-news-2024-04-26/\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bhp-consider-improved-anglo-proposal-after-bid-was-rejected-bloomberg-news-2024-04-27/",

It is still almost 45% off its all-time high of $50.\n\nGiven the market dynamics, we believe that a convincing break of $30 for Silver could see it scale to greater heights with $50 in sight.\n\nThere have been consistent supply deficits, and this is not yet factoring in the potential investment demand from exchange-traded products.\n\nWith Treasuries still holding well but the US debt level scaling like there is no limit, we could potentially see a devaluation of the US Dollar should demand for Treasuries dissipate. \n\nThis would favour safe-haven and inflation-fighting instruments such as gold, silver and commodities.\n\nAlso, Gold has been setting new record highs, silver is still lagging. With this tailwind, it could see a price surge as silver has both industrial and investment merits.\n\nClick Here for the Full Article:\n\n[https://thebigfatwhale.com/is-silver-going-to-be-a-great-investment-50-target/]",

A bit of history lesson here, during the early 19th century gold and silver fought to become the monetary unit of the world.

My point being if you\u2019re trying to protect yourself from inflation it\u2019s clear to pick the commodity that didn\u2019t get demonetization during the 19th and pick the winner.

I would assume it would take more than 10 professionals doing it 160 hours monthly and yet they would just read and not doing research, not consolidate data into tables, not write reports. Realistically it would take  hundreds people to process this.

You could compare those and find out how their administrative expenses per house changed because of that. Those two largest in industry but the whole industry operate in quite similar way. Note sales are far from being perfect but builders not going anywhere close to negative income numbers because of improvements in efficiency and some materials prices reduction.\n\nNow with understanding builders you can expect lumber or other building materials demand. If you following smaller companies they maybe focused on some region and so one.\n\nThis is just one industry and it quite simple to understand. However just getting through all builders it would take quite a time. As soon as low cap companies are not that interesting for funds, they are usually neglected in comments. For example MHO seems more dynamic than DHI and LEN, but I not found anything valuable online in addition to their 10k and earning calls.\n\nTo summarize, I do not believe individual investor would have reasonably enough time to research low and mid cap stocks 10k and earning call reports.

Take Ternium as an example\n\n\n\nTernium and its subsidiaries manufacture, process, and sell various steel products mainly in South America. This is cyclical company that is fundamentally sound. It doubled its revenue over the past 12 years through organic growth and acquisitions. It achieved a growing ROE with corresponding improvements in operating efficiencies. \n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/xCfGy3j6/Ternium.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xCfGy3j6/Ternium.png)\n\nWhen I last valued it a couple of weeks ago, there was a margin of safety.

I have nothing against replicating Buffett moves, but there is a huge risk of getting burned if we don\u2019t understand what the heck the move is and replicate only a part of it. With something like AAPL, it\u2019s simple. This, not so much. Remember, we can\u2019t see everything. We can mostly only see long positions. \n\nI initially thought this was an arbitrage play. Like ATVI. That makes sense if the price of SIRI doesn\u2019t keep deteriorating to below any advantage the arbitrage would have offered. If this was a pure arbitrage play, it already didn\u2019t work. \n\nIf this is a bet on SIRI, which it seems to be since they are also long SIRI itself, I can see the advantage in snapping up cheaper shares in LSMXA/K. But then again, they seemed to have timed it poorly so far and any advantage those shares offered was nullified. They would have done better to wait until after the merger to buy shares from all the people selling because they are not interested in the new share structure. \n\nBut then, they insist on these purchases despite all the above. Is it because BRK is too big to buy a large part of the float over a short period of time and is using this tactic to disperse its purchase? In that case, we would benefit from playing this like a Greenblatt merger play. Or is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nThere is no doubt SIRI is great value here IF it can return to consistent revenue growth.",

I've only gone back to the end of 2017 and Sirius XM has been consistently profitable every quarter, except for the 4th quarter of 2020 when they booked a $976 million dollar impairment charge for the acquisition of Pandora.\n\nAs I wondered why the internet music streamers haven't been able to start strangling them, I think that it's because Sirius XM is primarily a broadcaster (it pays a fraction for licensing music compared to Spotify) and it makes the FCC license to broadcast part of their moat.  The business also seems to exhibit a healthy stream of free cash flow to support the dividend and share repurchases.\n\nTed Weschler, on the other hand, has been studying satellite radio since at least 2006.  His hedge fund reported holding shares of XM Satellite Radio beginning in the 3rd quarter of 2006.  Ted also had shares of DirecTV and EchoStar Communications starting years earlier.

They recently announced entering a joint venture with SLB. The deal is SLB pays them 4.1B in cash and they keep around 0.4B of company cash. In return, they move their operations to a new entity where Aker keeps 20% ownership and SLB 80%. SLB also adds their carbon business to the JV for 0.5B NOK which is around the remaining cash Aker has now.\n\nHave been trying to wrap my head around what this means for investors in Aker. Do they hold a share of this cash in exchange for a 5x dilution in the new joint venture company? Or is it something else? \n\nAppreciate any answers from anyone who had something similar.

                "comment_body": "Intel is a play on the growth in demand for CPUs in the near future. Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",

        "post_body": "Alphabet and Microsoft are sending a clear message to investors: AI and Cloud Computing are two industries that are paying off.\r  \n\r  \nBoth companies released their earnings, and let us tell you, they did GREAT. Alphabet surged as much as 12%, pushing their [valuation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-parent-alphabet-reclaims-spot-2-trillion-valuation-club-2024-04-26/)past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose by as much as 3.5%, which is an impressive gain for them. \r  \n\r  \n**The Main Details:**\r  \n**Alphabet:**\r\n\n* New cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, the first in the company's history. \r\n* The board of directors also approved stock buybacks of around $70 billion. \r\n* Total revenue rose 16% from the same period last year.\r\n* Earnings per share beat estimates: $1.89 vs $1.53 expected.\r\n* Cloud revenue rose 30%, and Ad revenue rose 13%.\n\n**Microsoft:**\r\n\n* Total revenue rose 17%, and Profits rose 20%.\r\n* Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected.\r\n* Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud Segment rose 21%.\r\n* Azure and other cloud services rose 31%.\r\n* LinkedIn revenue rose 12%, Xbox revenue rose 62%, and PC revenue rose 18%.\n\nBoth tech titans are locked in a battle over the dominance of the AI field, but it seems as yesterday's results show that the market thinks these two companies have room to grow together.\r\n\n**Generative AI**\r  \n2024 is the year of generative AI, and it looks as though technology that can create text, images, and videos with prompts is here to stay. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAi to challenge Google\u2019s two-decade dominance of the internet, but Alphabet's own generative AI, Gemini, isn\u2019t too far back. \r\n\nThe space is becoming competitive, with both Alphabet and Microsoft executives saying their generative AI programs are driving more business for their cloud computing services. Corporate customers are also more open to making long-term investments in cloud infrastructure, increasing their trust in both companies.\r\n\nGenerative AI is giving a reason for corporations to come back and continue to use the cloud services of their company of choice. This gives the volatile tech industry some stability, with new demand and revenue coming in for both companies. \r\n\n**Google\u2019s Trailing Cloud Services** \n\nThis new intake in demand for cloud computing is a welcome turn for Google, which has long lagged behind industry veterans Amazon and Microsoft. After breaking even for the first time last year, the unit is now viewed as one of Google\u2019s fastest-growing businesses and best bet for growth as its core search advertising unit matures. Google\u2019s cloud operations pulled off a first-quarter profit of $900 million, well above analyst predictions of $672.4 million. \r\n\n**Gemini Comeback**\r\n\nGoogle\u2019s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks it had in the generative AI consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model, formally known as Bard but now rebranded to Gemini, was criticized for answering prompts with historically inaccurate images, promoting the company to stop generating pictures and depictions of people with its software.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since that obstacle, Google has been able to turn things around with Gemini. The enterprise product has told a very different story as the professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help ensure that the content released by the model stays consistent with their brand messaging to avoid mistakes like in Q1. Enterprise Gemini can be used to produce ads, videos, and podcasts.\r  \n\r  \n**Microsoft's Domination**\r\n\nThe narrative has been completely different for Google, with domination from the get-go. Generative AI has been an avenue for enterprise clients to spend more with Microsoft. The tech company has been infusing AI into the entire core product line with its technology partner OpenAI. \r  \n\r  \nThe bet is starting to pay off as customers are adding Microsoft\u2019s AI tools to help summarize documents and generate content. Alongside the addition of Copilat, Microsoft reported a 31% climb in revenue for its Azure cloud computing program, beating analysts expectations. 7% of this increase was attributed to AI which is a big deal. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub coding platform is also gaining more traction, recording 1.8 million new customers during this period an increase from 1.3 million of last quarter. This is largely due to their AI-coding assistant powered by OpenAI\u2019s largue language model, helping programmers streamline their code, answer any questions, and even convert code from one programming language to another. \r  \n\r  \nThe company is also seeing a large intake in their AI assistance tool meant to work synonymously with their Office suite software. The new tool costs companies an extra $30 a month on top of their existing subscriptions. Corporate customers are many in number including Goldman Sachs, Ford Motors, and Ernst & Young. Microsoft estimates that roughly 60% of the Fortune 500 uses Copilat.\n\n*Btw I wanna give credit where it's due:* [*This analysis was from here*](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe) ",

I am going into my summer of Junior year in college and will be working at an investment bank making good money.  Basically, all this money I have I am not going to need for a long time and would like to invest it. \n\nI have followed the markets extremely close and invested in stocks since freshman year of high school (first stock I bought was Tesla). Unfortunately, on my 20th birthday I had my identity stolen and my Robinhood with $35,000 liquidated. I didn't lose the money but haven't re invested it. \n\nWhen I think of what to do I want safety and I think the market as a whole qqq spy type deal is too expensive and lacking near term growth (in my view but probably wrong). I like gold but don't want to put all my money in a non growing asset. I like crypto but also think that would be dumb to put more money into crypto. I am thinking about buying a condo to rent out, but I have not decided yet.\n\nThis is a breakdown of my capital and curious to hear others input. As someone financially literate, it is mind numbing and extremely dumb that I am not even in like treasury bills but I am ready to make a change.\n\nCash: $65,000\n\nStocks: $15,000\n\nRoth: $22,500\n\nCrypto: $16,000\n\nMetals: $3500\n\nWould love the community\u2019s input and I will post in the future my moves!

I think Fairfax Financial FFH.TO or FRFHF makes great sense for up to 50% of the portfolio. It\u2019s very diversified and has a good shot at 5x in 10 years. Normally, that kind of concentration doesn\u2019t make sense but your portfolio is growing fast given your savings rate. E-L Financial ELF.TO or ELFIF, for 45% makes sense. It\u2019s like buying the market at a 50% discount so it\u2019s market return + how much the discount closes. The key is the high margin of safety. If you like gold, the final 5% in Mako Mining MKO.V or MAKOF makes sense. It\u2019s trading at a 20% FCF yield before growth and they have high return plans for the cash. In a gold bull, it could 10x in 10 years. It\u2019s controlled by Wexford Capital so it has grown up supervision unlike most gold companies and there is way more leverage with operators vs the metal itself.

Also if at any point repayments are late, then impairments are recognised. E.g. under IFRS 9 rules it can be in 3 risk weighting stages, stage 1 is fine, stage 2 you need to recognise a %  as impairments but can still recognise interest payments, stage 3 large % is impaired and interest it put into ECL (expected credit losses). So basically if the borrower is prime and repays fully its quite simple, but subprime gets complicated as you recognise losses upfront, but they will be later adjusted depending upon what actually happens. IMO its why credit as a % of GDP is far less to sub prime since 08 as banks simply aren't as profitable. Whereas mortgages still very safe and lucrative, but competitive.",

        "post_date": "2024-04-26T08:29:25",
        "post_body": "\r  \n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR) \r  \n\r  \nStory by Andrew Bary\r  \n\r  \nWarren Buffett will be at center stage, as usual, during Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting. But investors are increasingly looking for clues on what the company will be like when the longstanding CEO and chairman is no longer running it.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire could come under pressure to break itself up when the world\u2019s most acclaimed investor exits the stage. It might decide to pay a dividend rather than amass cash, as it does today while Buffett, 93, waits for investing opportunities. Buffett can expect to face questions on all these topics and more at the annual meeting on May 4 in Omaha, Neb.\r  \n\r  \nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett\u2019s longtime friend, business partner, and Berkshire vice chairman, who died last year at 99, won\u2019t be at his side. Munger\u2019s absence will only reinforce the obvious: Buffett\u2019s time atop the conglomerate he built over six decades could end during the next few years. Even Buffett acknowledges as much, writing in November that he felt \u201cgood\u201d but was \u201cplaying in extra innings.\u201d\r  \n\n\nFor some 30,000 Berkshire shareholders expected to attend the meeting, the future will be the focus as Buffett fields questions for more than five hours in what could be his only public appearance of the year. Joining Buffett on the dais will be Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, likely tasked with the role of Buffett\u2019s successor as CEO, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, who runs the company\u2019s insurance operations. Together they will answer questions small and large: Can the stock beat the S&P 500 index? Why have share repurchases declined since 2021? Can the company\u2019s new management prove anywhere as capable as Buffett? Should Berkshire break up?\r  \n\r  \nBut really, everyone will be focused on the same thing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhether it\u2019s said out loud or not, succession is front and center on the minds of investors,\u201d says Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst.\r  \n\r  \nThere is nothing like Berkshire. It has had an extraordinary run since Buffett took control of a struggling textile maker in 1965 and turned it into the world\u2019s largest conglomerate, with nearly 400,000 employees and U.S.-centric businesses that offer one of the best reads on the health of the economy. Some of its largest divisions are the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad; Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which operates a multistate electric utility business that is one of the largest producers of green power in the country; and the world\u2019s biggest property and casualty insurer, including Geico, the No. 3 auto insurer.\r  \n\r  \nThere are smaller units, such as NetJets, the leader in private jet travel; Clayton Homes, the top maker of manufactured housing; Benjamin Moore paints; Dairy Queen; and one of the largest real estate brokerage businesses in the country. Then there is a $360 billion equity portfolio led by Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Berkshire\u2019s holdings. There also is what Buffett calls a Fort Knox balance sheet, with nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire isn\u2019t run like other conglomerates. It is unusually decentralized, with Buffett leaving key decisions at subsidiaries largely to the managers of the individual companies. He wrote in the Berkshire \u201cOwner\u2019s Manual\u201d in 2017 that \u201cwe delegate almost to the point of abdication.\u201d Berkshire has a tiny headquarters staff of 26 with no corporate counsel, investor relations, or public relations staff.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire\u2019s unusual strategy has worked. The company is expected to generate $40 billion of after-tax operating earnings this year and has a market capitalization of $880 billion, the seventh-largest in the stock market. The company\u2019s Class A stock has risen to over $600,000 a share from $20 (there have been no stock splits along the way) since Buffett took over in 1965, and holders who bought the now widely held Class B shares when they were created in 1996 have seen that stock rise 20-fold. It\u2019s one of the most widely held stocks by individuals, with some three million shareholders. Probably no other company elicits the passion and loyalty of its investor base. Big institutions have never appreciated the stock as much as individuals.\r  \n\r  \nBut will they continue to, once Buffett is no longer running the show? So central is Buffett to Berkshire\u2019s business that four or five people will take over the role that he maintained until 2018, when he delegated responsibility for Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses to Abel and the insurance operations to Jain.\r  \n\r  \nAbel is due to become CEO, which involves overseeing Berkshire\u2019s vast array of businesses and likely determining capital allocation, a critical role at the company that Buffett has performed so well for nearly 60 years. That means deciding whether to use earnings to repurchase stock, pay dividends, build cash, or make acquisitions. Jain is likely to remain head of the insurance business, while Buffett\u2019s older son, Howard, 69, a farmer and philanthropist, probably will become nonexecutive chairman.\r  \n\r  \nThen there are Todd Combs, 53, and Ted Weschler, 61, who now run about 10% of Berkshire\u2019s equity investments and probably will run the entire portfolio. Berkshire doesn\u2019t say which stocks in the equity portfolio are run by Combs and Weschler, but Berkshire watchers think that many of the smaller holdings\u2014under $4 billion\u2014are theirs. These include Charter Communications, DaVita, Liberty Sirius XM, Amazon.com, Snowflake, Visa, and Mastercard. Buffett hasn\u2019t commented on their performance relative to the market since 2019\u2014when he said they were slightly behind it since joining the company more than a decade ago. We estimate that both are probably lagging behind the market since their tenures began, given the underperformance of some of their rumored holdings in recent years.\r  \n\r  \nInvestment manager Bill Smead, who heads the Smead Value fund, would like to hear from Combs and Weschler. \u201cNot introducing Todd and Ted is an unforgivable sin. If Warren dies tomorrow, they are the stockpickers, and they have never answered or been asked a question at the annual meeting.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCombs is a key member of the Berkshire bench and could be a backup to Abel as the Buffett successor or a potential successor to Abel as CEO. Combs has a good rapport with Buffett and has experience beyond investments as CEO of Geico for past four years and as a JPMorgan Chase board member. One candidate to succeed Jain as head of the insurance operations is Joe Brandon, who runs Alleghany, an insurer that Berkshire bought in 2022.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett\u2019s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett\u2019s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett\u2019s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\r  \n\r  \nAn important question, asked or not, is what will happen to Berkshire shares when Buffett steps down or dies. They may take a hit of perhaps 5% to 10%, as longtime holders cash out and investors worry that the Buffett magic will disappear. Buffett, though, has said he thinks the stock will go up on the day after his death as investors anticipate a value-enhancing corporate breakup.\r  \n\r  \nThere\u2019s a case to be made for a breakup. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest conglomerate at a time when conglomerates have fallen out of favor, with the likes of General Electric and United Technologies having broken up in recent years. For all of Buffett\u2019s investment acumen and business smarts, Berkshire stock is about even with the S&P 500 as measured by total return over the past 10 years and 20 years, Bloomberg calculations show. The stock has returned 12.4% annually over the past 10 years, against 12.5% for the S&P 500. Buffett has said that Berkshire needs to top it over time or investors should consider looking elsewhere.\r  \n\r  \nAll the massive outperformance came in Buffett\u2019s first 40 years at the helm, when the company was smaller and Buffett had a particularly hot investment hand, scooping up big stakes in companies like Coca-Cola and American Express at cheap prices. Size, too, is an impediment to outsize returns.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett hasn\u2019t had a lot of new winners in the past decade. The company\u2019s largest acquisition\u2014the 2016 purchase of Precision Castparts for $33 billion\u2014has been a bust. Buffett has had some misses in the stock market, selling a group of financial stocks including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase in 2020 and 2021 at about half their current prices. Of course, Apple has been a huge win with Berkshire\u2019s stake, now worth over $150 billion, compared with a cost of around $30 billion. But the iPhone giant is having a rough 2024, and its stock is down more than10% year to date.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire shares look like a good bet to match or beat the S&P 500 even after Buffett leaves the scene. The stock now looks appealing, valued at 1.5 times its projected March 31 book value of nearly $400,000 per Class A share and for 22 times estimated 2024 earnings. (Berkshire is due to report its first-quarter results on May 4.) Berkshire is slightly expensive relative to its five-year average of 1.4 times book value. The stock is ahead of the market this year and over the past five years.\r  \n\r  \nBook value is an old-fashioned valuation measure but is still relevant for Berkshire because of its large insurance operations\u2014insurers still get valued on book\u2014and because it has been a historical yardstick for the company since Buffett took over.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett chooses to focus on intrinsic value but doesn\u2019t disclose his estimate of that figure. Buffett has said that book value is a greatly understated proxy for intrinsic value, although share repurchases at current prices do reduce book value, somewhat undercutting the use of that measurement.\r  \n\r  \nPost Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s stock is likely to be supported by steady growth in its earnings and shareholder equity over time. The company appears capable of high-single-digit annual growth in book value based on $40 billion of operating income after taxes and gains in the $360 billion equity portfolio. If the stock keeps pace with the growth in book value, it could show similar share price growth.\r  \n\r  \nA dividend is a good bet within a few years of Buffett\u2019s death. Why? It will help his successor disburse some of the annual operating earnings. Another reason is that investors won\u2019t be so tolerant of Berkshire holding so much cash\u2014a record $168 billion at year-end 2023\u2014without Buffett at the helm.\r  \n\r  \nChristopher Bloomstran, chief investment strategist at Semper Augustus Investment Group, wrote earlier this year that Berkshire stock could generate a 10% to 11% annualized return over the next 10 years, with annual share buybacks in the 2% to 3% range\u2014above the recent rate of 1% to 1.5%. He pegged intrinsic value at around $720,000 a share.\r  \n\r  \nUBS analyst Brian Meredith is one of the few Berkshire bulls among Wall Street analysts. He recently lifted his price target to about $722,000 per Class A share from $715,000. He sees improvement at both Geico and Burlington Northern. Berkshire is one of the most defensive big stocks in the market, given its balance sheet and earnings power. A market selloff could offer opportunities for Buffett.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett is firmly against a breakup. He argues the conglomerate structure has numerous attributes, including tax benefits from the ability to quickly make use of any big catastrophe losses at Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies. Buffett has expressed confidence in the company\u2019s future, writing last year that \u201cBerkshire has been built to last.\u201d And the company\u2019s Buffett-friendly 14-member board\u2014including two of Buffett\u2019s kids\u2014is well aware of his views.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBerkshire has been run with enormous transparency, integrity, a long-term orientation, and a culture of stewardship. It is run by the greatest investor in history. That\u2019s the present,\u201d Chris Davis, an investment manager and Berkshire board member, told Barron\u2019s last year. \u201cAs for the future, every activist and investment banker will argue that in a world without Warren and Charlie, Berkshire\u2019s unorthodox structure shouldn\u2019t persist. I think it\u2019s worth defending.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhatever the questions, Berkshire shareholders will savor the annual meeting, knowing there may not be many more with Buffett at the helm. As for the stock, many may heed the advice of Munger, who said that \u201cthey should keep the faith\u201d rather than sell after he and Buffett are gone.",

I think current p/e is 10 and stock is very diversified in holdings.  Essentially even if they just return cash as dividend your downside is very low but solid upside.  Last food for thought but Buffet is 94 and others contribute a lot to the business who basically are there forever.  So business should be solid without him.  Genuine hope Warren stays in good health and keeps tap dancing to work.",

The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\n\n========================================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

However the useless CEO has been kicked out which makes this a potential recovery play IF a new good CEO is found that does the following:\n\n- Stops wasting capex on poor ROIC projects like small games and other stuff\n\n- Focuses their investment on fixing Payday3 and making it actually something decent.\n\n- Immediately cancels the Dungeons and Dragons shit IP they have bought (really they should focus on multiplayer shooting games only...)\n\n- Shuts down the third party publishing business\n\n- Fires 50% of the team\n\nThis is kind of similar to Meta in 2022, investors were pricing in zuckerberg just continuing to act like a robot and throwing money down the train at VR.\n\nIf a good CEO is found it's possible this could change.\n\nWhat the new CEO needs to do it fire a bunch of people as soon as they join and streamline the company.\n\nThe issue is they have an interim CEO who was an old board member and looks useless as well to me.\n\nThe question is, how much is the Payday brand still worth after they fucked up Payday3 SO badly?\n\nPayday3 only has 200 concurrent players now, whereas Payday2 has 17k. Even though it's an old title it still retains huge numbers and will still generate profit with more DLC.\n\nThoughts? I think this all depends on the new CEO but this looks like one of the situations where it probably can't get any worse given they have no debt, new potential management and cash on hand IF they get a good perm CEO\n\nI think this is worth putting on a watchlist and waiting if a new CEO comes in that isn't an idiot.\n\n>**The Board of Directors of Starbreeze has appointed the current board member Juergen Goeldner as interim CEO of Starbreeze, taking office with immediate effect.

The team is balancing hefty CapEx with strong income statement profit growth; the added context surrounding efficiency gains offsetting depreciation increases is important. The positive commentary on advertising demand bodes well for this company, and basically every other company left to report in the programmatic advertising space. It continues to turn Google Cloud into another quickly growing business with ample operating leverage. It continues to rapidly iterate in GenAI search. And? It continues to be one of the most iconic performers of the 21st century. Congratulations to shareholders on more profitable compounding.\n\nf. Microsoft's Take\n\nLike Google, Microsoft is second to none in terms of consistent execution and drama-less profitable compounding. And like Google and Meta, CapEx will continue to soar to support GenAI infrastructure.

Fastenal is paying out the bulk of its free cash flow as dividends, the dividend ratio is approaching 70% and it has been growing its dividend at a rate of 12% a year for the last 10 years. In fact, Fastenal just made it to the Dividend Aristocrat list, companies which has increased its dividend every year for the last 25 years.\n\nI look at the slowing growth of Fastenal and the need to payout so much of the earnings to dividends plus the need to increase the dividend annually as quite stressful when compared to Simpson Mfg, where the payout ratio is only 30% and the annualized dividend increase is about been 7%. \n\nBottom line, SSD has got more potential upside to be rated at a higher multiple than FAST whereas for Fast, if the business slows down too much, and they cannot increase their dividend, the stock will fall quite dramatically as the dividend investors move elsewhere.\n\nDo you agree with my assessment ?",

I expect more share repurchases to be announced with earnings, which should continue to help juice EPS.\n\nI'm not understanding why the market is ignoring the massive share repurchases the company continues to do. Apple bought back ~1.5 billion shares in the past three years alone, having spent:\n- $82.6 billion in 2021\n- $89.6 billion in 2022\n- $79.2 billion in 2023\n\nLast quarter they ended with $173 billion in cash/marketable securities versus $108 billion in debt. The CFO reiterated the long-term plan to go cash neutral. So with a net cash position of $65 billion, I expect Apple bought back a significant chunk of shares in Q1 and might even be a record for share repurchases last quarter.\n\nI know iPhone growth isn't encouraging, but services continue to grow at a double digit clip. With the share repurchases and healthy growth in services, why isn't Apple trading at a higher multiple? To me it seems like a deep value play relative to the other mega cap stocks and a no brainer to buy and hold. \n\nWhy is the market relatively so bearish on Apple?",

        "post_body": "Devolver Digital is a US company trading on the UK AIM exchange. I also think it trades OTC in the US as well, they are most known for being the publishers of hotline miami.\n\nThey IPO'd 2.5 years ago and have crashed since because some of their games flopped and previous management didn't do so well. They had a huge 2022 net loss due to impairment which means they invested a lot of money into some really poor games.\n\nWhat's interesting about them is they have:\n\n* No debt\n* A lot of cash\n* A terribly low share price\n* Management has very large stakes in the company and is incentivzed\n* New management is the original founders who made it successful in the first place\n* A back catalogue such as cult of the lamb which continues to produce them decent revenues\n* Most importantly they have some upcoming games that could be big hits, Human Fall Flat 2, Plucky Squire (my personal favourite, it looks similar to 'It Takes Two', Baby Steps (made by the creator of 'Getting Over It' which is massive), Anger Foot (I have played the demo and it's really really fun, the soundtrack is amazing) etc.\n\nManagement has delayed the above releases to make sure they invest in them correctly so they are big hits like cult of the lamb was, i.e they need to hit an 85%+ on Metacritic and 'very positive' reviews on steam for a game to really have a chance of being big.\n\nDevolver digital are well known for high quality games.\n\nSome potential risks:\n\n* They need to stop acquiring any more companies or they run the risk of destroying value by overpaying, although most games companies are at all time lows to be fair.\n* They have to make sure the above games are hits, if not their stock price will tank even further.\n* The stock is very illiquid, it's very hard to buy so put small limit orders in if you do decide.\n* Games companies are a bit like gambling with the odds on your side, they have lumpy revenues and need hits to keep growing, obviously if these games flop it's a disaster.\n\nHave a look into it\n\nThanks",

        "post_body": "Hello all! I'm a college student who got into value investing around 2020. I've slowly been learning more as I go along, and I'd like some opinions on my portfolio\n\nDIS-40%. This is easily my biggest investment, and for good reason. The business itself has survived through multiple financial crisis, multiple leadership crisis, and a global pandemic, and is now in a state where they can fully take advantage of the market. Their park business is one of the best businesses out there, with a great moat, solid earnings, and great margins. The linear business has shown resilience in the face of cord cutting, the DTC business is really beginning to show its fruits, and could be a real driver of growth. Even if Disney+ fails, worst case, they can make a lot bidding their content away to the highest bidders on streaming, with players like Netflix, AppleTV, and Prime Video bidding the content price up. IMO, this is still very undervalued for how good of a business it is. \n\nINTC-16.5%. Another great business. Their revenue and earnings slowdown mainly come from a global demand shortage for consumer CPUs, which will begin to pick up in the future. Pat Gelsinger has proven to be a great CEO while at VMWare, and the business is currently priced as if the revenue growth will only come from the foundry business. The foundry part of the business has been operating for the entirety of Intel's history losing money, it's only that now that it's independent of the CPU arm that people are focusing on it. Worst case, they spin off the foundry business and become fabless. With their connections, strong revenue, and overall dominance over the CPU market, that business will still prove to be extremely strong. \n\nTCEHY-13%. This is less a bet on China and more a bet on Pony Ma and his investment acumen. Pony Ma has proven himself an extremely good executive, and with the vast, diverse, strong, and high margin business that spans international markets, this is a great business to buy. China is easing restrictions and wants foreign dollars again, which is proving itself in a recent semi-rally in Chinese stocks.\n\nCVS-10.5%. This is the business I'm the most likely to sell. I bought in because the revenue growth and overall business seems strong, but they bought a lot of that revenue growth, and the regulatory environment has turned SHARPLY against them. It seems increasingly likely that their core business will get attacked by competitors, and leadership at the company doesn't exactly spark confidence like other companies do. Increasingly seeming like a value trap. \n\nSOFI-10%. This is less of a bank and more of an overall financial stock. It's proven to be a great grower, and the company was trading at its TBVPS, so I bought in. Leadership knows what direction they're going in, and understand exactly how to funnel customers into their pipeline. \n\nBABA-8.5%. Another China bet. This comes from the overall strength of the balance sheet, the share buybacks, and the potential that BABA has in the cloud and international markets. I'd hope to see Jack Ma be allowed to come back to BABA, but that's unlikely. Still, with China easing restrictions, this company is increasingly seeming like a company people can actually invest in again. \n\nWMG-1%. This is more of a temporary percent. I plan on buying more in the future, but it seems like the price has been falling, so I'm waiting for more of an entry. Robert Kynci is a great executive and really helped to make YouTube what it is today. They are embracing tech more than any of the other large labels, and the business is in a state of really transforming towards the modern music market, while the other 2 major labels remain a bit stuck in their ways. Music is also an industry that is likely to see rapid growth based on the growth of Vinyl, streaming, and overall merchandising of artists. Data has continually shown that Gen-Z spends significantly more on experiences and wants to support artists, which provides a great opportunity for WMG. Don't let the temporary metrics stray you away from this business, as it's a great opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if the percentages don't add up. I'm rounding a bit with this.

Your analysis of DIS shows nothing the market does not already know - outsize positions should be reserved for those with a hidden something the market is yet to discover\n\n3. Your INTC analysis has \"great business\" and \"slowdown\" within a few words of each other. Nowhere in your analysis is any discussion of the reliance on subsidies to prop up and \"grow\"\n\n4. Your TCEHY analysis is confused: you say it is a bet on Pony Ma and end up discussing China's need for dollars? You'd be better off talking about how you think they'll monetise WeChat, how they'll meet the challenge of TikTok, how they'll leverage gaming to boost their cloud business. If I was betting on leaders like you are here, I'd be one of the funds bag holding Twitter with Elon right now\n\n5. CVS analysis focuses on the risks - why? Because the share price is down 20% recently? If you're investing in single names you need to do what Buffett did at AMX in the face of the salad oil scandal: understand the risks and understand what the market doesn't and buy it when it's down 50%. Your analysis shows me you'll be selling low and buying the next boat that's already being pushed by a rising tide, rather than buying the one that's beached and patiently waiting for the tide that's about to come in\n\n6. Your bullish view of SOFI means you don't discuss its purchase of banks (you criticise acquisitions elsewhere) nor its risk due to Biden's action on student loans (you mention ss a negative the regulation changes facing CVS, but not here?). You are betraying your biases. Investing should be done in a very cold way, applying the same standards everywhere. What are the risks facing this company? Why isn't it making money consistently? You don't answer the basics. Better off in an ETF that invests in the theme you bought this for. \n\n7. BABA is \"another China bet\" - I thought you said TCEHY wasn't a China bet? Again, your spitting what everyone knows: cloud, international. Surprised you didn't mention AI. If you want a China theme, you can get it via an ETF, but by punting in two names you're taking a risk of unknown proportion. You might come back in three years and your 22% in these two names has doubled and is now 30% of the portfolio. You'll be patting yourself on the back, and wondering why they aren't 44% of the portfolio seeing as they doubled...\n\n8. You're betting only 1% of your portfolio on WMG? which is trading at about 20x EV/EBITDA? This is so out of character: with that level of ovevaluation I'd expect this to be at least 20% of your portfolio\n\nI'd be liquidating everything and investing in low cost thematic ETFs. Find one for streaming (DIS, WMG), find one for China and Emerging Markets (TCEHY, BABA), find one for fin tech (TCEHY, SOFI), find one for healthcare (CVS), funds one for semis (INTC). That's five so 20% in each. And next time you see a company you like, find an ETF for it and make sure it's not an already existing theme in your portfolio and trim your existing winners to invest in the new one. Keep doing that until you have enough ETFs that don't duplicate risks. Rebalance regularly, trimming winners and adding to losers. \n\nYou asked for free opinions, and these only cost 2 cents.",

The advantages of being a huge corporation rather than an indie studio in terms of getting an audience in has shrunk\n\n3. Audiences are far more aware of which movies are OK or good from social media and avoiding them in theaters and waiting for streaming. They are only going to movies that their friends rave about.\n\n4. There is growing international competition in entertainment and we are all now aware from various pieces of media that audiences are open to Korean or Japanese cinema and TV.

        "post_date": "2024-04-25T06:17:43",
        "post_body": "\n**Key Insights:**  \nFLIC has shown remarkable resilience during major financial crises, including the 2008 global financial meltdown and the recent 2023 turmoil in the regional banking sector. Despite these strengths, its stock has been overlooked and is currently trading at levels similar to those seen in 2008-2009. When getting into the weeds you'll see FLIC has tons of liquidity, zero doubtful rated loans on the books, rock solid dividend yield and history, insiders consistently buying shares, corporate buy backs, owns the real estate of at least 20 of their 40 branch locations (in NYC/Long Island), upcoming earnings (after the bell today) and dirt-cheap options (low volume though so be careful).\n\n* **Aggressive Buybacks:** With a continuous $15 million buyback program and hefty insider purchases, there's a clear signal that those in the know believe in FLIC\u2019s future.\n\n* **Affordable Options:** The options market for FLIC is invitingly priced, providing a cost-effective way to potentially profit from future stock movements, just be careful as they are low volume typically. Hopefully we will see an uptick with earnings today.\n\n* **Proven Stability:** FLIC has navigated past financial storms with strategy and grace, bolstered by recent tech upgrades in fintech and cybersecurity.\n\n* **Financial Health:** Solid capital ratios underpin its ability to maintain operations and seek growth, enhancing its appeal as a robust investment.\n\n* **Attractive Dividend Yield:** For those looking for reliable income, FLIC\u2019s strong track record of dividends is a major draw, especially if you\u2019ve been burned by riskier bets this week. At first glance the yield at nearly 8% may appear unsustainable but when doing you DD you'll see that it is a sustainable number and the stock is just cheap at the moment.\n\n* **Valuation and Earnings:** Given the ongoing buybacks, insider enthusiasm, and strong fundamentals, my target price of around $17.40 based on a P/E of 15 and an EPS of $1.16 seems achievable for this stock before the end of the year. FLIC's annual report pegs the book value at $16.83/share which you can see in their SEC filing and I believe once the regional banking sector rebounds FLIC will get right back to $17+. \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFLIC\u2019s blend of strategic buybacks, insider confidence, and significant movement on small volume, alongside its solid financials and undervalued options, make it an intriguing prospect for those looking for a mix of safety and growth in the financial sector.\n\nBut bottom line: it's undervalued and the company has been around 100 years.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is for informational purposes only, not financial advice. Always do your own research or consult a professional.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 290 Shares\n* 10 \u2013 9/20 $10 C\n* 5 \u2013 12/20 $12.50 C",

Operating Income is different from EBIT, and therefore my intuitition tells me that using one or the other has consequences for the later valuation process with, for example, companies that have a significant amount of earnings from non-operating activities investments or credit lending. Is this correct?",

I think they are using debt wisely, even though it\u2019s destroying their book value. If they continue to pay it down as they have been and also continue with the share buybacks it feels like it could be a low risk home-run.",

During the Subprime meltdown he did special deals with Goldman and BofA - as mentioned already with loans that converted to stock at a preset price or preferred shares or warrants that accomplish the same.

        "post_body": "I originally viewed TDM as a plantation Group with a healthcare arm. About 17 years ago, the healthcare segment only accounted for about 16% of the Group revenue. The Group plantation operations then was mainly in Malaysia and this accounted for a large part of the Group\u2019s revenue. \n\nThe Group decided to expand it plantations segment by venturing to Indonesia. It took several years to get this going such that the maiden revenue from the Indonesian plantation was only in 2013. By then  the Group had \u201c..earmarked that the growth of the plantation operations will be in Kalimantan.\u201d \n\nBut things began to go wrong with the Indonesian operations soon after. The losses and impairments got so bad that the Group announced its plans to sell the Indonesian assets in 2019.  By 2023 it was still trying to complete the sale of its Indonesian assets. \n\nIf not for the healthcare segment, which had grown to account for 56 % of the Group\u2019s revenue in 2023, TDM would be in a worse shape.\n\nMoral of the story? Beware of companies announcing expanding into foreign countries as the Malaysian experience may not always be transferable. \n\nGiven the poor plantation segment performance, the market took a dim view of the company despite a growing healthcare segment. I guess the market is still waiting for TDM to prove that it can recover from the Indonesian lesson. \n\nRefer to \u201cIs TDM a value trap?\u201d if you want to bet on its turnaround. \n\n[https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more](https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more)",

        "post_body": "(Downvote if you do not want to see this type of articles. Do not downvote because you do not agree with the article)\n\n**A Value Investor\u2019s Guide to Navigating Technology Disruption**\n\nBy Mark Iong\r \n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/value-investing-technology-stocks-s-curve-40230f6a?mod=djem\\_b\\_Weekly%20Barrons%20feed%20for%20last%2024%20hours\n\nTectonic shifts occur more frequently in technology than in other sectors, so investors need to be wary of tech companies that are approaching the mature stage of what is known as the S-curve.\r \n\nThis curve, shaped like the letter \u201cs,\u201d is a visual representation of the growth path that technology companies tend to follow. It begins with slow initial growth (the bottom of the \u201cs\u201d) then moves with rapid upward growth as adoption takes off, finally arriving at the plateau stage, at which businesses become increasingly commoditized, growth becomes saturated, and returns trend lower. Companies in the plateau stage of the S-curve often find it difficult to recapture their momentum, particularly in the tech sector, where megatrends tend to be irreversible. Consider the evolution of computer technology from mainframes to PCs and servers, to mobile and the cloud\u2014each development a paradigm shift that didn\u2019t reverse course and that rendered the previously used technology less favored and eventually obsolete. With artificial intelligence, a similar seismic shift is now under way.\r\n\nAs value investors, we naturally gravitate to the uppermost section of the S-curve. Quality companies often become undervalued by the market at this stage, providing the opportunity to buy at a significant discount relative to their long-term intrinsic value. But we need to be highly selective, identifying businesses that have the competitive moats and defensive characteristics that will extend the upward slope of the S-curve into the new technology frontier instead of entering the plateau stage.\r\n\nBy contrast, mature tech companies risk succumbing to the \u201cinnovator\u2019s dilemma,\u201d a term coined by the late academic and business consultant Clayton Christensen to describe how companies cling to their established markets and protect profit margins instead of focusing on innovations that might disrupt their core businesses but also open up new opportunities for growth. As new entrants exploit this complacency and carve out a niche in the market, legacy businesses eventually fall victim to a shrinking profit pool, as capital flows to new entrants that offer products with more power, efficiency, scalability, and affordability.\r\n\nWithout innovations to alter their weakening fundamental outlook, the old guard may see profits dwindle and their valuations deflate. It is a slow bleed, a value trap that lulls investors with seemingly cheap metrics but masks a bleak future. We feel it is important to avoid these long-term secular losers that might seem statistically cheap based on today\u2019s valuation. A company trading at a depressed price-to-earnings multiple, for example, could be \u201ccheap\u201d for a reason, reflecting a declining business where valuation could remain low indefinitely or worse, continue to compress.\r\n\nThere are several important traits we look for when evaluating maturing technology businesses. They need to be innovative with an eye toward the future, developing new products and services that can position them for the next paradigm shift. Management needs to be willing to disrupt themselves, even if doing so risks revenue and earnings losses in the near term. We witnessed several companies created in the early days of the internet, for instance, that successfully navigated their way into mobile computing in the 2010s and are now attempting to repeat the same playbook as they make strides in the AI era of the 2020s.\n\nPlatform companies are probably the best examples of businesses that are most adept at steering through disruptions. Such companies have an extensive ecosystem of first-party software and hardware products and third-party partners that rely on their platforms. Cloud computing exemplifies this dynamic today, where several players control the majority of the market and are essentially the gatekeepers for all things artificial intelligence and cloud computing. In technology subsectors such as semiconductors and enterprise software, we seek those firms with durable business models and robust product road maps that can serve as the foundational layers of the next megatrend.\r\n\nTechnology companies primed for long-term success understand that disruption is a marathon, not a sprint. Conversely, those that struggle to adapt and innovate are the ones most likely to stumble. Value investors who recognize this could be primed to take advantage of outperformance in the tech sector. \n\n============================\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post_body": "* Cormedix (CRMD) is a biotech company that primarily focuses on the prevention of Catheter Related Blood infections with their leading product, Defencath. Catheter Related Blood Infections plagues the End Stage Disease Population. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease Institute, nearly 808,000 people suffer from this ailment, and approximately 69% are on dialysis([https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:\\~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)))\r\n* Defencath is a catheter lock solution that eliminates both gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections that develop within the Catheter. Defencath is composed of a solution of taurolidine and heparin that effectively reduces the CRBSI events in this vulnerable population.\r\n* However, this population has a catheter that is surgically implanted into their patient and its called a, \u201cCentral Venous Catheter.\u201d This type of catheter is placed near a large center vein most commonly an internal jugular or subclavian. In layman terms, it\u2019s placed near the patient's heart, implanted on the patient to administer medication or to administer hemo-dialysis.\r\n* The results of their Lock-100 Study had 71% reduction in CRBIS compared to the control (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37678222/). Additionally, They rejected the null hypothesis by a P value of .0006 to such a degree that it would only occur in 1 in 10,000 tries due to sheer random chance. Therefore, the phase III study was halted.\r\n* There are approximately 250,000k CRBIS events per year according to this site,([https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:\\~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019))\r\n* You can check the company\u2019s most recent deck to see the potential impact of Defencath on CRBIS here, ([https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation\\_1-7-23.pdf](https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation_1-7-23.pdf))\r\n* **As of November 15, 2023 Cormedix received a NDA Approval by the FDA for the limited population of Adult patients affected by kidney failure**( [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/#:\\~:text=About%20CorMedix&text=DefenCath%20has%20been%20designated%20by,address%20an%20unmet%20medical%20need.)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/#:~:text=About%20CorMedix&text=DefenCath%20has%20been%20designated%20by,address%20an%20unmet%20medical%20need.)))\r\n* **As of January 30, and April 9th 2024, Cormedix secured CMS J-Codes for In-Patient and Outpatient settings**.( https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-and-reimbursement-updates/) and ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/))\r\n* **On April 19, 2024, Cormedix Also Secured TDAPA reimbursement from CMS for the Out-Patient Setting**([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/)).\r\n* Lastly: on April 15, 2024, Cormedix Celebrated their commercial launch for the in-patient setting, and expect to lauch out-patient by July 1st 2024.

Additionally, other insiders have not sold any shares over the past few years. I heavily weigh insider ownership whether they were paid for, awarded, or granted in lieu of payment. You can see all insider activity here, ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/insider-activity)).\r\n* T**he institutional ownership** acquired about 33.94% of total shares on the open market with Black Rock Inc leading with 3,507,695 Shares held as of 12/31/23. Numora Holding Inc, comes in second at 2,946, 552 shares, then Vanguard at 2,825,335 million shares, and lastly Elliot Investment Management L.P., comes in at 1,550, 523 million shares. See all institutional ownership here, ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings))\r\n* Y**ou\u2019re probably wondering at this point, how does Defencath work, and what are the Projected vials to be sold?** Cormedix projects to sell 3.4 million vials on the inpatient side and over 37 million vials on the out-patient side. The growth potential is HUGE!\r\n* **With such volume you\u2019re probably wondering at this point how precisely does the product work\u2026** Well, Every Time a patient receives hemo-dialysis the catheter must be flushed with the Defencath solution before and after. That is approximately two vials per patient per visit with the average patient getting about 3 treatments per-week, out of 550,000 patients on hemodialysis.\r\n* Cormedix plans, and is on track to launch Defencath for out-patient setting on July 1, 2024.\r\n* Cormedix Plans on expanding its usage and application of Defencath to other populations that already have CVCs, like Oncology.\r\n* The current short interest as of 3/31/24 is 34 million dollars or approx. 8.2 million shares.\r\n* **Marketing Plan**: There are 5 major companies that control the out-patient setting, and two of them control 70% of the market. Remember, Out-patient is projected to sell appx. 37 million vials!\r\n* The Projected market impact of the stock is incredible, and understanding the product shows the extreme value it holds.\r\n* **Debt:** the company has NO debt.\r\n* **Market Exclusivity:** CRMD has 10.5 years market exclusivity because it's a qualified infectious diseases, and it's a new chemical entity. And it\u2019s intellectual property is extended until April 15, 2024. See ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/))\r\n* **WHY WILL CRMD EXPLODE SOONER THAN ANALYISTS EXPECTATIONS?**\r\n* The out-patient setting is dominated by 5 major out-patient facilities, and once it received it's NDA every medical Journal posted the NDA approval AND JOE, MENTIONED THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING TO BOTH IN-PATIENT AND OUT PATIENT FACILITIES AT March 12th Earnings Call \"March 12, 2024 \"Joe Todisco, CorMedix CEO, commented, \u201cI am excited about the Company\u2019s recent progress as we have scaled up activity ahead of our commercial launch in April. **We have received significant inbound interest from both inpatient facilities as well as outpatient dialysis providers with respect to DefenCath, and we are actively engaged in customer discussions in both settings of care**\" ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:\\~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)))\r\n* **Competition:** There is no Drug on the market that prevents CRBIs the way Cormedix does and there is absolutely no competition.\r\n* The CTXR guys will say we\u2019re competition but we\u2019re not. Mino-lock salvages an already infected Catheter. It\u2019s a reactive medicine opposed to Defencath which is Preventative.\r\n   * The preventative application allows for such high sales values in such an exclusive market.\r\n* **CREDIT TO Fretwizard125,** \u201cGood post and summary of what\u2019s in play here. I\u2019ve been in CRMD since 2018 and Have been accumulating. Have a multi-hundred thousand dollar position and am waiting for this to explode. With TDAPA we could see 70-80% market penetration really quickly, (1-2 years).\r\n   * The Wholesale Acquisition Price FROM CRMD and approved by CMS is $250/vial. They will likely offer discounts to the providers to adopt and recognize revenue too. But even with a 70% discount for a vial potential revenue is insane.\r\n   * Quick math $75/vial x20,000,000 vials (50% penetration) =$1.5b. Yes billion, with a B.\r\n   * This does not include other indications they are trying to expand into including oncology and TPN. Oncology market is 1.5x the size of hemodialysis. This is a long term hold with literally the most perfect commercialization setup I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d--- Credit to Fretwizard 125\r\n* Projected Price: Low $9.00 per share, medium is $12.00 per share; high of $19.00 per share within the next year. I believe we\u2019re going to hit the 9s in july and potentially hit 20s before December.\r\n* **TLDR:** Cormedix(CRMD) Is Deep Value. It hit\u2019s all of the marks. CRMD is poised for huge growth over the next year, reaching over a billion sales. The market is unique, and they\u2019re going to be the standard of care. The stock is primed to explode at any day. I believe the stock will be at least 25$ per share by March 2025 if not $35-$40 per share. 5 Major companies control 100% of the out-patient market. They\u2019ll be announcing contracts in the coming weeks. I think we can hit 12$ before the out-patient launch in July, that\u2019s my opinion.\r\n* **All RISK IS ELIMINATED!**\r\n* **POSITION:**\r\n   * 50 call contracts $6 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K Exp. June 21\r\n   * 50 call Contracts $7 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K exp June 21\r\n   * 3750 Shares average $4.15. (have a little bit of higher average because of options trading throughout the past 3 years.)",

I don't know about the USA, but in my professional experience by far the most people with end stage renal disease have an arteriovenous shunt, and NOT a catheter. Having a (central venous) catheter is usually just for temporary dialysis, or as a bridge to getting a shunt or a peritoneal dialysis catheter (which is not a central venous catheter).

That\u2019s one way a person can get CRBIs.\n\nThey also have a CAP to seal the catheter to prevent things from getting in.\n\nHowever, the catheter still must be sanitized between each hemodialysis before and after.\n\nSo that\u2019s where Defencath replaces Heparin because it\u2019s 21% more effective; and defencath targets both gram positive and negative bacteria as well as fungi\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that many of these companies develop product specific solutions, and that regardless of caps, and patches biofilm will still develop within the catheter which is why defencath is necessary.\n\nLastly, again, Mino-lock is only used after a Catheter is already infected. So if Defencath fails then mino-lock is used.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions in these products ensures understanding the deep value cormedix holds with their Defencath CLS (Catheter Lock Solution) .\n\nEdit...

I believe more speech is good speech. And people can decide for themselves if they want to invest in CRMD.  No one is being forced, influenced or fooled into buying this stock. I'm sharing an opinion and people can take what they want from it. Buy, not buy, or forget about it, or wait then buy....

        "post_body": "Hello,\n\nI wrote up an article that provides a framework for evaluating and comparing quality compounders like Hershey using key metrics and analyzing long-term trends in the financials of the business. By interpreting financial data visually in the key areas outlined below, we can more easily identify businesses with the potential for sustained growth and value creation over the long term.\n\n* Price and Volatility: Understand the risk profile and market perception of a company\n* Income Statement and Balance Sheet: Understand the company's earnings, assets, and financial health.\n* Valuation: Assess the value of a company relative to its peers and industry.\n* Return of Value: Explore a company's strategy for returning value to shareholders.\n* Industry Comparison: Benchmark a company against its direct competitors. \n\n [How Hershey Can Be Your Golden Ticket for Evaluating Investment Opportunities](https://quartest.substack.com/p/how-hershey-can-be-your-golden-ticket-90b)\n\nI have been developing this financial framework for analyzing stocks for quite some time now and thought you all might be interested in it. I would also greatly appreciate your feedback on the analysis and my writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR Summary of my Hershey Analysis:\n\nHershey's consistent revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth have historically warranted a premium valuation to the market. The financial strength and resilience of the business have consistently placed Hershey as a top performing in the consumer staples sector. These returns have been well justified, as Hershey has continually demonstrated efficient uses capital, as evidenced by its high return on invested capital, equity, and assets. Its attractive return strategy, including dividend payouts and share buybacks, have provided a sound value return for shareholders.  \nHowever, Hershey has recently been faced with perceived challenges in maintaining sustainable earnings growth in an inflationary environment with skyrocketing cocoa prices and tough competition from snacking rivals. While Hershey's five-year historical EPS growth lags behind some competitors and has recently slowed, its valuation has potentially come down to reasonable levels given the quality of the business and its strong cash flow generation. Nevertheless, Hershey's ability to navigate external factors including  market dynamics and further cost fluctuations in its inputs, will be crucial to the company's long-term success.\n\n",

Combinations of several factors over several years leading to an amplified outcome. \n\nPlants were not replanted in 2020, and there\u2019s been mismanagement in governments of growing regions in Africa. So you get 1 in a century rainfall last year with El Ni\u00f1o impacting global weather patterns and that was the catalyst. Now you have some regions with swollen shoot disease in 30% of crops. They\u2019ll still produce but have very low yields until replaced. This is in large due to the fact that there\u2019s been aging plants out there not replaced as they should have been.\n\nThere\u2019s other regions in the world such as South America where cocoa comes from to begin with, that have suitable growing conditions. There\u2019s also climate controlled solutions which would take more capital but remains an option.\n\nAdditionally, at 11% cocoa use, Hersheys chocolate is 1% above the legal threshold to call it chocolate. This also gives them a low cost advantage on their peers. Boutique chocolate goes about 40%-60%. Cadbury is 20%+, M&M\u2019s Mars flagship chocolate is about 20%. Anything semi-sweet is in the 30%+ range.\n\nThere\u2019s a variety of hedges Hershey has in regards to cocoa. This commodity supply crunch isn\u2019t their first rodeo. They\u2019ll do just fine in the long run with plenty of levers at their disposal to deal with this short term noise.",

Moreover it is an \u2018orphan crop\u2019. Much of the capital is not put into growing it as the farmers are often poor smallholders (or medium sized ventures which may or may not rely on slave labor) with little capital and the big companies just buy through intermediaries anyway. So all the capital is downstream from the growing, so to say. This, plus the fact that a grower can\u2019t move his land uphill as the climate warms, is all very stratifying.

However, it's not suitable for the majority of retail investors.\n\nI generally wouldn't recommend active stock picking for most retail investors. The more you learn about it, the clearer it becomes that active investing isn't the best strategy for the majority. Instead, retail investors should focus on passive investing through diversified ETFs, understanding risks, diversification, and proper portfolio or asset allocation. Most importantly, they should get to know their own investor behavior.\n\nUnderstanding one's risk tolerance and creating a long-term, sustainable investment strategy that one can live with is crucial. For those still keen on learning about stock picking, it might be wise to limit this to about 5% of the portfolio. This can help mitigate the risk of capital loss while still allowing for significant learning outcomes in comparison to their broader market portfolio.\n\nI emphasize passive investment because there is strong empirical evidence showing that the market outperforms 80-95% of institutional investors after fees over any 10-year rolling period. This trend is even more pronounced over longer periods.",

        "post_date": "2024-04-22T08:03:02",
        "post_body": "This week, I feel compelled to acquaint those unfamiliar with Benjamin Graham, the cornerstone figure of value investing. \n\nRegarded as the \u201cFather\u201d of this discipline, his seminal works, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, serve as indispensable guides for investors. Graham\u2019s principles laid the groundwork for the legends of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and continue to inspire legions of aspiring investors.\n\n>  \u201cThe intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\u201d  - Benjamin Graham\n\n# The Teachings of Benjamin Graham\nGraham imparted numerous invaluable lessons, but today, I wish to highlight three that I consider pivotal for enhancing one\u2019s investment acumen:\n\n## 1. Invest in the company, not the share price\nWhen we purchase just one stock of a listed company, it is no different from buying the entire business. That one share gives us ownership rights of the company, including a proportionate share of the company\u2019s profits. So we are NOT buying a share but rather a company.\n\nIt may seem like I am stating the obvious. Yet, even today, people trade stocks because of their volatility rather than the underlying fundamentals of that business, and even \u201cinvestors\u201d quickly overlook the basics of a company because they don\u2019t want to miss out on the latest trend.\n\nWhile there are stories of success trading stock and people retiring early because of  \u201cthe next big thing,\u201d there are far more stories of going broke due to the same strategies. Unfortunately, those stories are seldom in the media, posted on social media or spoken about over the dinner table.\n\nIf we want to be successful investors, we must understand the company we are buying, how it generates revenue, the costs to run it, and the risks involved. The more we know, the more confident we will be when we invest, and although that doesn\u2019t guarantee success, it dramatically improves it.\n\n## 2. Invest at less than it is worth.\nGraham, being an investor during the Great Depression, was always acutely aware of the risks of investing in the stock market and how easily fortunes could be lost. Therefore, he believed in investing with a Margin of Safety, which means buying shares in a company at a discount to its true worth or intrinsic value.\n\nIn Investing Chronicles above, we discussed the historical average P/E of the S&P 500, which is around 20.5, meaning that, on average, the price of the S&P 500 is roughly 20x the combined earnings of its constituents. If we assume this is the fair value of the index, then whenever the index is trading below 20x earnings, we have a margin of safety. The lower the P/E, the greater the margin of safety.\n\nSimilarly, for a company, once we have analysed the business and its economic drivers, we should be in a decent position to derive an estimate of its intrinsic value. If we believe the company to be worth $100 million and the market currently values it at $150 million, why would we purchase shares?\n\nHowever, the opportunity is evident if that company has a current value (market cap) of $75 million. More importantly, buying it at $75 million provides us with a safety net because our calculations might be off (almost guaranteed they are), and the company\u2019s actual value could be $80 million. Of course, the actual value could be $120 million, but you get the point!\n\n## 3. Let the Market Come to You\nBesides \u201cMargin of Safety\u201d, Graham is also famous for coining the term \u201cMr Market\u201d, referring to the bipolar nature of the stock market.\n\nIn the stock exchange, as with all things involving human beings, emotions get involved, and one could argue that when money is involved, we get highly emotional. The higher the emotional charge, the higher the capacity to act irrationally.\n\nEuphoria will likely occur when share prices appreciate and money is made. Market participants throw caution to the wind during these times, feeling nothing can go wrong. As a result, investors overpay for assets. We can see this currently, at least in my opinion, as certain tech stocks are valued as though the stars have aligned.\n\nOf course, the opposite is true too, when fear takes grip. During these times, irrational, pessimistic market participants convince themselves that they will lose all their money and sell while running for the hills, screaming, \u201cThe sky is falling\u201d. During these times, valuations can plummet to illogical lows.\n\nOur goal is to remove our emotions when investing.\n\nInvesting in the long term is a fantastic strategy because it allows us to ignore short-term market noise and fluctuations, especially if we understand what we have bought. We are in a hugely advantageous position to take advantage of Mr Market, buying when fear is at its peak and selling to the overzealous buyer.\n\n# Summary\nSo be more like the Father of Investing:\n\n- Know what you are buying,\n- Know what it is worth, and\n- Only buy it when you can get a substantial discount.\n\nIf you can master the above, you are well on your way to being better than most.\n\nHope you enjoyed this.

But even if he did and I\u2019m not aware, you also have to take the context of the P/E into account\u2026.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked at it but let\u2019s say you are correct about historic P/E being at 20x. Okay. But that was before companies were buying back shares (and retiring those shares) like crazy. That means there are less shares of quality companies to go around. While in a vacuum the P/E should not change with shares bought back, you aren\u2019t considering the DEMAND for those shares staying the same or even increasing. There are plenty of research papers arguing that due to the prevalence of share buybacks we may be entering a world where higher P/Es are standard, at least for a while. \n\nAlso, I would say that China\u2019s current low P/E is NO indication of \u201ccheapness\u201d but rather of lack of quality and higher risk.",

So when you buy directly comparable companies at 20x multiples vs 30x multiples, and the price falls for both, you're more likely to lose more money on the 30x multiples company than on the 20x multiples company simply because you can assume a baseline at constant earnings.\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the company's earnings being stable - a company with volatile earnings cannot be measured like this.",

If 2 companies in the same industry have dramatically different valuations, then there's usually many reasons for that difference. It could be very well the case that the lower price multiple company is more risky during a time of duress. For example, jp morgan vs all the smaller/medium sized banks in the last couple of years.\n\nThe value principle here is that by taking on more risks in those lower price multiple companies, you also raise your expected return.",

Nvidia has been nearly alone on the field, with more than 90% market share.\r  \n\r  \nBut fresh competition is coming\u2014from companies big and small\u2014and the battle will be fierce. The stakes couldn\u2019t be bigger: Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has sized the AI chip market at $400 billion by 2027. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That\u2019s almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.\n\n. . . . . . \n\nA few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make\u2014or, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.\r  \n\r  \nHuang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren\u2019t the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well\u2014or better\u2014than Nvidia.\n\n. . . . . \n\nNvidia\u2019s rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won\u2019t be winner-take-all. It isn\u2019t game over. It\u2019s game on.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia\u2019s most obvious challengers are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\n\n. . . . . . . ",

New CEO, writing off values since Supreme Acq., insider buying, etc. I think it has potential to turn around with these key changes coming and recent activity.

The CEO is a brand builder, at least that's the promise. Brand value takes a long time to build, Vans is a pretty great brand already, The North Face is ok but not great in its market, Supreme is sort of a meme brand IMO.\n\nThe pessimistic outlook is that turn-around stories rarely turn-around, their best strategy may end up being a buy-out.\n\nThe insider buys are not actual buys, they are share packages the board gifted themselves (lol) after hiring the new CEO. I don't think anybody on the board has actually spent their own money buying shares.",

This stock is 100% in oversold territory. \n\nThe North Face brand is huge in Europe and will only grow larger in the US given they are establishing a new commercial organization and regional platform in Americas region, replicating the strategy used in the EMEA which grew the north face. Not only does it have significant market share in outdoors, climbing, it only has a growing market share in street fashion and casualwear, and the inner-city kids in europe love them. Their parkas and puffers are also deeply embedded in europe rap/drill/grime culture.\n\nHere's a recent quote from Bracken Darrell :   \nWe have a team working on about five different strategies such that they (The North Face) are relevant 365 days a year, at least outdoors, not just when you're not on the mountain in winter. We tend to skew more males than females, so we have ample opportunities for women.\n\nTNF growing   \nVans bottoming and turning back to growth    \nSupreme bottoming   \nTimberlands bottoming",

Add on the current conflict and split opinions the impact of GLP-1s on their business, they may struggle for some time.\n\nRegarding interest rates, their products are largely financed when purchased. The selling price in the US is about 2-2.5x that OUS. Payback periods are quick based on an ASP of $130k but high rates are still deterring purchases. Lenders have also been slower in lending. INMDs clientele are also not wealthy. Average income of $60k. They are sensitive to higher interest rates.\n\nGeopolitical risk will be there for some time but the US being right off the coast should keep things from getting out of control. All 3 of INMDs primary manufacturers (outsourced) are in Israel. They have a buffer from the borders but Israel is so small that it may not matter much if things do escalate. GLP-1s in my view are not an issue. Overall, it should boost demand.\n\nLaser-based products have an installed base of 40-50k in the US. IMND was at around 7.5k at the end of 2022. INMDs products do the same things as lasers (for what they market them for), but better. They are finding new indications (ENT, Ophthalmology, Women's and Men's health) to increase their TAM and have a pile of cash they will have to do something with. All of this with strong IP protection through this decade and likely into the 2030s. Long-term, I think they recover just fine. Short-term may be ugly though.",

Israel does not have the world's most powerful military, and the US (which does) is not a combatant in Gaza. It is heartbreaking nonetheless. The fact remains that Hamas started this war by massacring and kidnapping civilians, and they prolong it by exploiting their asymmetric 'advantage' of hiding amongst the civilian population. Hamas should surrender. Instead, they vainly neglect their duty of care to those they purport to represent and defend.",

Otherwise, if your intention is to invest with a long time horizon (5+ years), I\u2019d strongly recommend the majority of qyour portfolio being a couple broad, low-cost index funds \u2014 VOO is a terrific choice.\n\nYou can explore the various options for ETFs using a tool like [this fund screener](https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-screener).\n\nIf picking stocks, you should be able to explain your thesis to someone. You should also be aware of the company\u2019s fundamentals. This takes time and effort, but is essential. I would strongly recommend listening to earnings calls: They provide important insights into a company and its leadership. The Quartr app is a great tool for this.\n\nEDIT: I see you invested in some of these companies because they pay a dividend. Might be worth reading up on the considerations.

If that doesn't appeal to you, just go with something straightforward like VTI or VOO. Try to keep individual stock picking to no more than 5% of your total investments.\n\nAs a beginner, it's easy to make expensive mistakes and challenging to consistently outperform the market over the long term. Don't take my word for it; there's strong evidence showing that simply holding onto market indices beats 80-95% of managed mutual funds over a decade, and the results are even more pronounced over longer periods.\n\nAt this stage, you likely don't have the expertise needed to effectively manage the risks associated with picking stocks. It's better to grow your wealth passively and maybe experiment with a small portion of your portfolio to get a feel for the market. This way, you minimize potential losses, which saves more of your capital for investing once you've mastered the basics and developed a solid strategy.\n\nPicking individual stocks is tough. It involves a deep dive into financial reports, understanding business models, analyzing fundamentals, forecasting growth, and estimating the true value of a company. This process requires a lot of reading, a solid grasp of financial principles, disciplined effort, and considerable time.

That\u2019s trend that will likely continue (the GPU-heavy data centers, that is). Obviously, traditional CPU dominant data centers would present more opportunity.\n\nAlong with their deal with Nvidia (not dead as you mention \u2013 that\u2019s just the acquisition), they are partnering with Google as part of their data center stack.\n\nThey are of course very prevalent in mobile, but lack pricing leverage. We\u2019ll see if that changes.\n\nOverall, it is are for sure overvalued right now\u2026 but to say nobody uses ARM is flat out wrong.",

ARM creates Instruction Set Architectures, including reference designs for the cores that implement those ISAs. Yes they do not produce full processors, but they don't need to. Many companies, such as Mediatek and Allwinner, license ARM cores in their processor designs.\n\nHowever they also give out Architectural Licenses to companies that want to implement ARM ISAs from the ground up in their own core designs. Apple and Samsung are the most famous examples of users of this license.\n\n> ARM instruction set is not even good anymore, its opensource alternative, RISC-V, is well designed and popular. ARMs main competition, MIPS, has gone opensource.\n\nWhile there is industry interest and effort in making RISC-V gain traction, it is hardly \"popular\" in mass production commercial applications. The bulk of the RISC low and ultra low power chips manufactured today are based on ARM architecture.\n\nIt is entirely possible that in a decade or so RISC-V will have 50% market share, but there's still a lot more work to be done on that front.",

For example, if you decide to invest in a company that has ok earnings now but is expected to grow by an average of 20% per year for the next 3 years that that might be considered a value investing strategy assuming it hasn't been priced in already. \n\nThe market is efficient, and most news about the present and future is factored into the price almost immediately. The times when innefciencies usually exist is during uncertainty. In uncertain times,  future information is in limbo, and investors tend to react negatively to the news. wich typically drags the price of a stock down and creates temporary undervaluation. The undervsluation could be warranted, or it might just be an overreaction to capitalize on. \n\nThe other time undervaluations exists is due to the difficulty of making accurate future predictions about a company. The larger the growth variance, the more inaccurate the prediction. But always remember growth and value are two sides of the same coin.\n\nI'd read some Peter lynch books as a beginning to merge the ideas of growth and value together. It is the riskier side of value investing. But, even Warren Buffet recognizes that value and growth are related.\n\nRemember, the DCF valuation model is based on growth, earnings, and the discount rate used.

Think of it as high earnings/cashflow predictability and low earnings/cashflow predictability.\n\n Take a look at PepsiCo, I'd argue that investing in PepsiCo today isn't value investing because the growth is too low to justify its current valuation. However, its earnings are highly predictable. If for an immaterial reason the value of PepsiCo contracts, perhaps a macro event, or Wallstreet investing elsewhere, then it may easily become a value investing opportunity when purchased at the right price. \n\nNow, take a look at Microsoft/Apple. I'd argue that many times in the last 10 years, these have been value picks (perhaps less so today). High multiples for a good while, but justified by reasonable growth and reasonable short-term (10 years) earnings predictability.\n\nNow look at Nvidia, very rapid growth, very high multiples, very low earnings predictability. I have no clue what Nvidia's cash flows will be in 4 years. How can I estimate the company's value when I can't reasonably estimate their cash flows. Are they going to double this year like they did last year? Are they going to double again in 2025? Is the AI push going to drive sales in perpetuity, or will there be enterprise upgrade cycles? I have no idea, and even industry veterans should be cautious when companies grow this quickly.\n\nLook at Spotify, lots of topline growth, bottomline inches towards profitability, and a market dominating product. How can we, with reasonable accuracy, estimate margins and cash flows for a company that has never turned a profit. In 5 years, will their operating margin be closer to 15% or 0%. We've never seen them earn a profit, so predicting how profitable they can be is very difficult.\n\nNow look at Ford, a PE of ~5.7. But compare their operating cash flow growth today vs. 10 years ago, then look at how much of their cash flow from all sources they have reinvested in the company over the last 10 years. You'll find that they need to reinvest nearly all of their cash flow just to run in place. Not value, and unlikely to become a value pick.",

Growth is not a guarantee, so it's technically requires you to understand the industry well to make hypothesis on technical moat, network effect etc. Value investing from Ben Graham was originally \"cigar butt\" investing which meant finding old companies whose book value was higher than the current market cap of the company. Berkshire Hathway was originally a failing textile company in Massachusetts when Buffet bought it. \n\n\"Value investing\" is kind of hand in hand with Buffets ascension, as before him it was relatively small. As such the interest in value investing has expanded as people like Munger or Monesh Pabrai entered the field. These guys were more ideas driven and companies like Berk started buying companies like Apple, which acts as both a value and growth stock. So there is a venn diagram of companies that satisfy both requirements. \n\nBut to give a clear cut example - NVDA or AMZN only appeal to growth investors. Their P/E multiples quite literally never fall low enough for someone like Buffet to invest as their price is only justified by constant growth. A company like Pepsi on the other hand, is way pass growth phase. Microsoft is probably your best example of a sweet spot. \n\nHow well each category does is pretty sensitive to interest rates, the economy, and market sentiment. If a recession hits, value stocks will outperform growth stocks. In low interest boom time, such as the last decade and a half, growth stocks will beat out value. \n\nSo no they are not the same except for time of investment.",

        "post_body": "Most of these are from Warren and Charlie obviously\n\n1. I won't buy a company if I don't like using their product. Disney is a good example of this for me.  I for a while now have thought a lot of their content is sh**, even when Iger was in charge.  Not saying it's not a good buy, but just not for me\n2. I won't buy a company if I don't like their ceo.  And in general I want to really think the ceo is smart, talented and capable. One of my favorite CEO's right now i Satya Nadella. Elon Musk is a great example of a CEO I don't like.  He's brilliant but an a** hole and way to mercurial for me.  Even if TSLA started trading at a great price, I'd pass.  Cyber Truck epitomizes my greatest concern with someone like Elon.  \n3. I won't buy \"Cigar butt\" plays or companies.  I feel like the downside is often underplayed (zero gains or a minor loss) and the best upside is often doubling your money and then selling.  Then you have to find another company and repeat.  Paramount is a company that comes to mind that I passed on for this reason.  I'd rather buy a company I can hold for the long run if it does well.  \n4. I won't buy the most current hype stock. Right now Nvidia.  2021 was Bored Apes lmao and before that TSLA.  It's not that these are always bad plays but I want to avoid FOMO causing a loss.  There are plenty of opportunities out there imo.  When Nvidia is everywhere the chance of it being a good price isn't great.\n5. Certain business I avoid with no exception.  Car companies, commercial airline, Pharma/bio tech, tobacco and clothing retail come to mind.  A good stock right now that represents this is CROX.  It might be a great buy.. or it's just a fad.  I'd rather buy something a bit more certain. I'm starting to think all brick and mortar type stores should go here (kohls is the new BBBY change my mind).  What others would you all add to this?\n6. I won't invest in Chinese companies.  I'd also add any country that is extremely corrupt, unstable, etc. \nAlibaba is peak for me on this one.  In general I think an Authoritarian rule is too much of a threat to make up for this risk honestly.  I passed on Alibaba this whole time and so far so good.  Will continue to pass on it and all Chinese companies.\n7. I won't invest in companies with questionable moats.  I think Paypal comes to mind right now.  Is it a good price? Yes.  Do the numbers look good.  Also yes.  Does the moat look good? No.  20 years ago sending money was hard.   Preventing and managing fraud especially was hard.  With the advent of the smart phones came reliable 2 factor authentication. That and ai (formerly known as machine learning lmao) has massively cut down fraud on these platforms (meaning it's an easier business to create and not lose a shit ton).  Additionally all active banks moved into the internet age making sending money a hell of a lot easier.  Google and Apple are positioned extremely well to compete and I believe it will definitely hurt Paypal over the next decade. Both also have a shit ton of cash which is nice when you are involved in the world of money and credit.\n8.   I won't buy a stock that I can't see myself still owning 10 years from now.To be clear, I not saying I will hold stuff for 10 years.  I'm just saying that's the long term timeline I want to be thinking on.  A great business should continue to do well for the next decade at least... If it's in situation where that's a concern, you might want to look at something else\n9. No companies that are heavy handed on the politics.  It's a distraction, it's exhausting and misses the point of a business.  This goes for left and right wing companies.\n10. \u201cBe Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful\u201d - Warren Buffet\n\n\nAlso, I'm not saying any of the stock above are bad.

I'll admit, its not a buffet stock at all, but it does seem to have a good value provided the potential I see with what they're doing.\n\n04/29/2024  \nAMD: \\~250B market cap  \nNvidia > 2.2T market cap  \nIntel: \\~ 130B market cap  \nTSMC \\~620B market cap  \nSamsung \\~ 310B market cap  \nIf I'm going to buy one of these companies with the most upside over 5-10 years, I'm struggling to see how intel isnt a strong contender given the current price. If Pat executes on his plan and becomes number 2 behind TSMC thats at least 2x upside and probably more. Hard to see a world where if Intel returns to growth, its not at least valued similarly to AMD.\n\nIm encouraged by the major increase in R&D spending.  This is the pain of their missteps. Intel is partly in the situation its in because previous CEO's neglected EUV and other technological advances to preserve margins. Now, Intel will be the first to rollout High NA EUV. Theyre going to be the first to do backside power delivery. Theyre focusing heavily on being the innovator they once were before an MBA took over as CEO (as opposed to an engineer like Pat).\n\nI know there are many other metrics to look at other than market cap. Revenue has been declining, earnings have been declining, it seems as if everything will continue downward but I doubt this trend will continue much longer.  At the current price, it looks like there is at least a reasonable expectation of preserving your investment and a solid chance at large upside if Pat executes and I might add... theyve been executing so far on their plan. The sales/revenue/earnings just havent come yet. Maybe it never will, but I think its a good bet.\n\nAll this being said, I would love to see what others are thinking about and the metrics they care about when evaluating this sector. I think that the chip industry is going to be one of the most important of the next 50 years.  I'm still learning and will also be buying the fidelity select semiconductor mutual fund if there is ever a broad downturn. ",

Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",

                "comment_body": "I bought Intel at 48 couple years ago and sold it at 48 this year right before earnings when it dropped significantly. \n\nI sold because after getting to know the industry there were a couple things that bothered me.\n\n1. I thought AMD and Intel always had been kinda a 50/50 player in both CPUs for laptop, desktop and datacenter. \n\nHuge mistake cause AMD used to have nothing and Intel used to own the market. AMD really got out of the bottle a couple years ago and Intel will never be able to crush them so badly again that AMD can't get into the market like they used to. \n\nSo going forward, they will have to share more of that market with AMD and have lower margins.\n\n2. x86 architecture. I thought this was also a part of their moat. Them and AMD are the only ones who can technically make these CPUs and therefore I thought they wouldn't have additional competition. Then Apple came with their M1 ARM based  chip and made MacOS be able to run on it. Not much later I see Windows slowly being able to run on ARM as well. \n\nSo now, suddenly you see more competition for the laptop, desktop and soon datacenter CPU space as well beside from just AMD. I wouldnt be surprised if Nvidia also goes after some market there. Qualcomm already trying to do it. \n\nSo Intel went from having basically zero competition in the CPU space to full on competition (which is still increasing). Nvidia being a 2 trillion dollar company now (compared to a maybe 10% of that when I invested in Intel) gives them access to raise capital extremely easy too...  \n\nI dont know how much cloud still needs x86 architecture, maybe still for a couple years, but im not betting on it.\n\n3. GPU wise Intel is years away from coming anywhere close to Nvidia and AMD. Especially in the datacenter GPU. Nvidia has been working on this for the last 10-15 years and AMD for quite a while as well while Intel just recently started a couple years ago. Will be years before they launch anything decent here.\n\nThen there is Mobileye. I just don't know about this one. I thought they were gonna spin off more shares at a 50bn valuation 2 years ago but they were too slow. Its hard to see whether Mobileye will be competitive enough or not with other big companies in the self driving industry..\n\nThe only good thing is are the investments in foundry. The US will invest a lot in it but TSMC and Samsung will also build foundries in the US. Nothing is certain here for Intel although I think some companies will like to use both TSMC and Intel to diversify supply chains.. \n\nI'm not touching the stock anymore for the foreseeable future.",

For the sake of brevity, I'm going to ignore CPU and GPU which I believe are key to Intel's potential success. Rather I'm going to write about the Fab which has been what kept me away from the company.\n\nThe main problem with the semiconductor industry is you're either ahead and everyone uses you or you're behind and you start to bleed customers. It's not like Coke and Pepsi where it's down to consumer preference there is typically an objectively better technology that can be mathematically quantified. \n\nFurthermore, new semiconductor foundries are extremely expensive and have very high fixed costs. If these foundries don't run with significant volumes then expect them to burn cash. \n\nTSMC has in recent times had the best process technology and companies like Apple, AMD, and Nvidia collaborate with TSMC to share R&D costs and in exchange for early access to TSMC's new process technology (Node). This is a big benefit for these companies because it leads to more efficient better performance products thus leading to higher sales and more collaboration with TSMC. Naturally, this is sort of a self-perpetuating cycle where TSMC benefits from other companies' R&D.\n\nFor these reasons, the semiconductor industry is sort of naturally monopolistic. \n\nTo overcome this Intel needs to build multiple billion-dollar fabs. Catch up with TSMC on process technology and build strong relationships/tools so other customers can manufacture at Intel Foundry services. Even if this is accomplished they need to stay in the lead against a TSMC which will no doubt see this as an existential threat to themselves and possibly even their country. All of this is extremely expensive and carries major risks to the company.\n\nFurthermore, what happens if there's a glut of supply from the semiconductor fabs? After all Global Foundries Samsung and TSMC are all building fabs. Do we really need all this increased capacity? If Intel builds these hugely expensive bleeding edge fabs and there's a recession or semiconductor glut then I'd imagine the fabs will quickly start burning cash. Even if Intel has the best process technology.\n\nIt would be one thing if Intel was still a CPU monopoly but those days gave sailed. It just appears to me that they're pursuing this strategy from a position of weakness and I fear it won't end well. \n\nThe irony is this strategy was tried before by AMD with global foundries and it almost bankrupted them. Intel's gambit seems similar and it has me worried that the result will be the same. That said it will be brilliant if they pull it off.",

Well, your data centers sales were lower than we wanted, so 10% of the stock is getting sold.\n\nThe market reacts terribly to bad news, bad to good news, and only okay to great news.

Most people on wall street aren't overly interested in making a lot of money. Post 2008, everyone on wall street wants to mitigate any risk and is more focused on a risk free return. That means wall street hates uncertainty; after all, why potentially lose your job betting on a beat down Intel, when Nvidia and AMD are market darlings, and you're very unlikely to lose a lot of money in the short term on those companies. \n\nRemember this about wall street: it's not about making money, it's about not losing money.

Need some specialty software? That definitely wasn't made for arm. Oh, your software is compatible with arm? Which version of arm? Because there's multiple, and you're forcing consumers to choose when they try to download an application from chrome. There's also new security risks, the fact arm continually changes their architecture, and the continually terrible lifespan of arm chips.\n\nApple was able to have the M1 because they control a lot of the ecosystem, and most normal users on a mac are just gonna use a few different things. PC users, on the other hand, will download almost anything, run almost anything, and use almost anything, while Macs don't. Even then, most people running programming tasks and in education that are using the apple laptops still look for the Intel version, simply because a lot of software just doesn't work on arm.\n\n  \nWhen you consider that most devs know x86, most programming tooling is built around x86, most EE/CS programs primarily teach x86 for prospective computer engineering students interested specifically in working in computers, and most programs todays that aren't supported anymore will never move to arm, but will stay on x86 forever, then yeah, I'd say that x86 is a better long term bet. Servers can switch because they run a handful of programs, but pretty much everywhere else has major issues. Gamers will never be able to switch, as the complexities of programming a videogame in arm is very different, and every single game on steam only supports x86.",

Modern x86 is very similar to RISC in the sense that all the instructions are just stored in the Micro-ops cache. The core itself is functionally a RISC core and  as such benefits from most of the same type of inherent power efficiency as ARM. This is supported by Jim Keller who said something along the lines of instructions only matter a little bit. \n\nIt seems to me that the only advantage of ARM is that it's an open license. This is nice but on the other hand, CPU development is so expensive and complex that I see the market sorta being naturally duopolistic. Either way, x86 isn't anywhere near dead yet.

An investment bank/internal corp dev team is gonna contact institutional investors and offer to buy shares back at a slight premium. \n\nCompanies definitely do buy back shares on the open market, but these are bought through various firms and institutions and spread out over years. After all, if google just dumped 80 billion into share buybacks in a day, you'd have major liquidity issues in the market. If you want your shares to be bought by Google, just continually sell and buy over a long time, and, eventually, one of those shares will be bought by Google.\n\nYou shouldn't buy a company because of share repurchases. Companies generate FCF and choose to spend it on a few things. They can buy other companies, service debt, reinvest it, distribute it as a dividend, buyback shares, or just sit on it(maybe I missed a few). Buying a company shouldn't be based on how they distribute their cash, but rather how much cash they make. After all, if you could buy a 100 dollar business that generates 20 dollars for it's owners, but chooses to reinvest that cash, that's probably better than a 100 dollar business that generates 10 dollars, and openly distributes it.",

        "post_body": "Cooper-Standard, a leader and global suppliers of sealing systems and component, fuel and brake delivery, and fluid transfer systems was a pre-pandemic money tree cranking out over $8 EPS. During the pandemic, when global light vehicle production was cast into the depths of hell, multiple competitors within the space were forced to close shop; although $CPS remained afloat it did not come out unscathed. Instead, the stock plummeted into freefall, and was down over 90% from it's all-time high. But like my grandma says, when there is blood in the streets, buy real estate. And gentlemen, I have opened $CPS as my largest position and it's my 2024 best-performer pick. Let me explain why.\n\nDuring the pandemic, global light vehicle production volumes fell to a low of 77.6 million units in 2020. Mr. Fu Bingfeng, President of OICA, described the sharp downtrend as \"the worst crisis ever to impact the automotive industry.\" Due to being inherently dependent on light vehicle production, Cooper Standard's top line was obliterated. They went from an untouchable EPS and EBITDA monster to complete stagnation.\n\nWith production annihilated, it is no surprise that eight auto parts suppliers filed for bankruptcy between 2020 and 2021. While Cooper-Standard survived the chaos, revenues declined by over 35%, and shareholders experienced a 90% drop in share price. During the post-pandemic recovery, another major headwind emerged. The UAW strike once again halted light vehicle production for three of Cooper Standard's largest customers. Today, these obstacles have been successfully navigated, and the ascent to reclaim the throne has never been more clear.\n\nLight vehicle production is now on a tear for a multitude of reasons. First, the average age of a vehicle on the road is currently sitting at an all time high of 13.6 years. That coupled with the fact that current domestic auto-inventory sits at 1.4 months (meaning the current stock of automobiles could only supply 1.4 months of sales) creates a huge impetus to start cranking out vehicles. And vehicle production = $CPS profits. Better yet, the vehicle production numbers from Q1 2024 are significantly exceeding consensus predictions. In every month in 2024 to date, vehicle sales have been significantly higher than in 2023. In March alone, vehicle sales were more than 100,000 units greater in 2024 than in 2023.\n\nThis boom in vehicle production and sales has lifted all major automakers than have already reported 1Q earnings, as they continue to beat and raise guidance.\n\nAs far as the financials are concerned, $CPS revenue and adjusted EBITDA show a clear inflection point in 2021, and with leaner costs from restructuring, coupled with the vehicle production turnaround, $CPS is poised to head to the moon gentlemen. Despite the clear path forward, the stock continues to trade \\~85% lower than its ATH. A major reason for this was the conservative guidance set forth by management at the Q4 earnings call, but during the call, the CEO of the company himself said, \"*Clearly, our light vehicle production units and the guidance that we've used for '24, you can see there are -- continue to be a bit conservative, I guess, is how I would describe it.*\" Well, the numbers coming in so far for 24 are far from the conservative estimates put forth by management, and I expect a resounding beat will be the result at their Q1 call in two weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: As mentioned above, I have opened a position in $CPS and as always do your own DD.",

Since 2019, management had made cuts that have contributed $479 million to adjusted EBITDA. They have improved operating efficiencies with smaller fixed cost structure, have higher margins on EVs due to them requiring 20% more content per vehicle, and renegotiated contracts with customers.  In short, they\u2019re making more money on each car manufactured, we were just waiting for production to ramp up (which the Q1 vehicle sale numbers so far suggest has already started to happen.).  These sales numbers are approximating 2018 levels DESPITE interest rates remaining high, imagine what car sale volume will look like once rates are.\n\nThe debt is primarily long-term debt, which allows Cooper Standard to ride the tailwinds current in place within the automotive industry and pay back that debt as the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",

I wonder what their 'true' ROIC looks like.\n\nHowever, it would only be fair to look at companies like GOOG the same way and deduct the value they give back to shareholders through buybacks and now the dividend. Just as you seek to deduct the reinvested capital of AMZN.\n\nAnd another thought...\n\nIf you felt it were significantly undervalued using P/FCF if they didn't re-invest so much, wouldn't EV/EBITDA tell the story better then?

Tech change can see a shift in cost or benefit and first mover / scale advantage can be gone quickly, especially if the scale is based upon short lived investments that face a short obsolescence cycle and need replacement - like IT hardware.\n\nAt one time people thought there was no alternative to IBM.  Operational cost from scale is not a long term moat.  First mover is an advantage only if it blocks competitors out - which in history has been a geographic or network effect story.\n\nPeople don\u2019t switch from Apple ecosystem because of what they would lose.  Facebook has a similar network effect advantage.  Msft has high barriers to change because all the devs would need retraining to move away from Msft enterprise.  Google is at risk but there is an intersection of tools and monopoly that make it the gorilla you HAVE to work with.  All of these tech companies are actively working to leverage their strengths to defend their moats and make them stronger and integrate with AI.\n\nIs there anything similar wrt AWS?  Network effects?  Lots of investment on their customers side that would have to be redone?  An obvious pathway to staying ahead of the surprise innovation out of left field that takes out the scale advantage?\n\nI get the arguments on the shopping portal side, but that business has not been terribly profitable in history.  I don\u2019t see where the durable moat is wrt an industry (cloud compute) that is racing towards commodification with competition that can afford to sell cloud at a loss because of the benefit they get from integration with all of their other datasets and services.\n\nAny high margin business attracts competition.  Everyone races to innovate and in the process prices tend to crater.  Eventually it becomes a commodity market.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to prove you wrong, I\u2019m genuinely trying to understand this idea that Amazon has a durable moat.  Is it some sort of proprietary container code that can\u2019t be replicated?  Is there some specialized knowledge and an army of workers that would need retraining?  Is there a patent that gives Amazon a durable cost advantage?  Why would companies (cloud customers) be willing give their supplier strategic pricing power over their bottom line?  What is stopping a lower cost producer from taking share with better operational tech?\n\nI\u2019ve heard this idea that all the aws container code would have to be rewritten.  Why couldn\u2019t an LLM do that?\n\nWhat is preventing competition from taking business from Amazon?  What will prevent commodification?",

With a PE currently sitting at 1.5, the market has heavily beaten down this stock as it operates in multiple challenging segments and areas. First of all, it's located in China. Which we all already know how hard just that can make a stock tumble. Two, it used to operates solely in the online consumer finance market place. Which several years ago, suffered through heavy regulation from the CCP. Third, it is a subsidary of creditease, who old a majority position of the shares. Even thought these are some very clear big risks, I do believe the upside is quite big as well.\n\nThe upside:\nThe margin of safety is quite big, the company has 0 debt, and hold a cash pile of 800 million USD, which is almost two times larger than the companies market cap.\nThe PE is 1.5 - however, over the last year, with the addition of its new insurance and online market place units, growth has been over 30% per quarter, and they have began using the cash on hand to invest into buying similar companies around the southern Asian area.\nThe growth potential is there, with all of their three segments posting solid growth in the past year, and forecast for the next year being growth of over 20%\nROIC over the last two years has been 20%+, and it is likely to continue next year\nShare repushases have began, and with the huge amount of cash on hand, and extremely low PE.

                "comment_body": "Just to add to what others have said:\n\n1) it\u2019s so that you can evaluate the business on its own merits.  Financial engineering is a real thing, compare a property rental company where they can buy assets with either 100% cash or 10% cash and 90% debt - the debt holders only receive a fixed income while any profits above this go directly to the shareholders after taxes, which means the return on investment can be hugely affected by the debt levels.  Therefore the merits of the business itself can be distorted by debt.\n\n2) It gives a clearer picture on how much debt a company can repay.\n\n3) Debt can distort the apparent value of a company, especially when using an earnings multiple as a valuation technique (e.g. a PE ratio). There are a few different ways that this could cause an error in judgement here: a) say EBIT is $100 and interest $90 leaving a profit of $8 after tax (at 20%), if companies in this industry are usually valued at a PE of 15, then you might think that the company should be worth $120 ($8 x 15).  But what if the company only has a year or two left on its loans?   Then the value would be radically different.  b) Another scenario, using the same figures above, is what if the company is growing very rapidly?  Using the same multiple to value both the business and the debt would clearly be an error in valuation. i.e. if earnings before tax in the following year is $200, the year after that $400, and the year after that $800, and if the debt and interest rates have remained unchanged at  just $90 interest per year, then applying an earnings multiple to the after interest figure would probably under value the company.\n\n4) A company is made up of the business itself (the assets, working capital, staff etc) and how it is financed (capital structure).  Debt is very easy to place a value on and usually the balance sheet figure is sufficient, though there can be exceptions that I won\u2019t get into.  So why complicate your evaluation of a business when you can simply deduct the debt at the end of your evaluation?  Having debt in the evaluation complicates things unnecessarily.  Again, there are exceptions, especially if the company has either significant debt - where a closer examination of the cash flows would be required, or very little debt - could be ignored for simplicity purposes.",

Sure, there's an additional cost relative to organic growth, but that doesn't mean acquisitions are expensive relative to management's other opportunities at the time or their actual cost. If you don't have attractive internal reinvestment opportunities, or if gaining scale or scope quickly is important, it can be prudent to grow by acquisition. Similarly, if the rate on your debt is better than the price you pay for the acquired company, so long as it doesn't stretch you on leverage or coverage, it is also accretive to grow through acquisition.\n\n'Recapitalize' isn't an inherently dirty word. Look at a company like Transdigm. They have routinely recapitalized, particularly taking on debt to fund acquisitions, and like to run ~5x leverage. It has worked for them for decades, and they are not the only company to employ a similar strategy. When it comes to capital allocation, the answer is always 'it depends'.",

Over the years, [I've worked on (and released) and open-source algorithmic trading platform called NextTrade](https://github.com/austin-starks/NextTrade).\n\nWhen working on NextTrade, I made a few critical mistakes. While I won't go over them in detail, these mistakes range from:\n\n* Making NextTrade too slow \n* Not making it configurable enough \n* Making it far too niche\n\nSince then, I've been developing a new platform called [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/). Unlike NextTrade, NexusTrade is freemium. I've done a lot of work making it suitable for all types of traders and investors. Some specfic features that would interest this group include\n\n* [Algorithmic trading using fundamental data](https://medium.com/p/95b0267a0dba)\n* [AI-Powered Stock Screener](https://nexustrade.io/blog/new-feature-launch--an-ai-feature-that-no-other-investing-platform-has-20240213)\n* [More traditional, UI-Based Simple stock screener](https://nexustrade.io/blog/i-just-created-the-worlds-best-stock-screener-20240404)\n\nThese features make it really easy to find value stocks and apply them to your algorithmic trading strategies.\n\n[I wanted to share my thoughts on making NexusTrade a freemium app.](https://medium.com/p/120ce4c90e3c) I think that by it being free-to-try, it can encourage the skeptics to actually try it out and see their results. However, it's also not cheap to host this platform, and I need to strike a balance between usefulness and cost-effectiveness.\n\n[My full thoughts are here.](https://medium.com/p/120ce4c90e3c) I'm really curious to get some feedback on how algorithmic trading can be applied to value investing, and what particular features are you looking out for in such a platform.",

Of course he's using reddit to bring a bit of visibilty to his project, who can blame him ? What are the alternatives ?

With this tailwind, it could see a price surge as silver has both industrial and investment merits.\n\nClick Here for the Full Article:\n\n[https://thebigfatwhale.com/is-silver-going-to-be-a-great-investment-50-target/]",

As about additional information you could check 10k reports of similar companies to understand better.\n\nFor example Lennar and DR Horton published their time to build house and those numbers somewhat improved. You could compare those and find out how their administrative expenses per house changed because of that. Those two largest in industry but the whole industry operate in quite similar way. Note sales are far from being perfect but builders not going anywhere close to negative income numbers because of improvements in efficiency and some materials prices reduction.\n\nNow with understanding builders you can expect lumber or other building materials demand. If you following smaller companies they maybe focused on some region and so one.\n\nThis is just one industry and it quite simple to understand. However just getting through all builders it would take quite a time. As soon as low cap companies are not that interesting for funds, they are usually neglected in comments. For example MHO seems more dynamic than DHI and LEN, but I not found anything valuable online in addition to their 10k and earning calls.\n\nTo summarize, I do not believe individual investor would have reasonably enough time to research low and mid cap stocks 10k and earning call reports. As soon as this is the most important thing to do, there is no reason to look anything on top of that, before it is done. I not sure you would read till end though, as I not get answer on how much time it would take to read one 10k report for you.",

It doubled its revenue over the past 12 years through organic growth and acquisitions.

I have nothing against replicating Buffett moves, but there is a huge risk of getting burned if we don\u2019t understand what the heck the move is and replicate only a part of it. With something like AAPL, it\u2019s simple. This, not so much. Remember, we can\u2019t see everything. We can mostly only see long positions. \n\nI initially thought this was an arbitrage play. Like ATVI. That makes sense if the price of SIRI doesn\u2019t keep deteriorating to below any advantage the arbitrage would have offered. If this was a pure arbitrage play, it already didn\u2019t work. \n\nIf this is a bet on SIRI, which it seems to be since they are also long SIRI itself, I can see the advantage in snapping up cheaper shares in LSMXA/K. But then again, they seemed to have timed it poorly so far and any advantage those shares offered was nullified. They would have done better to wait until after the merger to buy shares from all the people selling because they are not interested in the new share structure. \n\nBut then, they insist on these purchases despite all the above. Is it because BRK is too big to buy a large part of the float over a short period of time and is using this tactic to disperse its purchase? In that case, we would benefit from playing this like a Greenblatt merger play. Or is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nThere is no doubt SIRI is great value here IF it can return to consistent revenue growth.",

        "post_body": "I have been trying to wrap my head around this for two days. AkerCarbonCapture (ACC.OL) has 4.25NOK market cap currently. They recently announced entering a joint venture with SLB. The deal is SLB pays them 4.1B in cash and they keep around 0.4B of company cash. In return, they move their operations to a new entity where Aker keeps 20% ownership and SLB 80%. SLB also adds their carbon business to the JV for 0.5B NOK which is around the remaining cash Aker has now.\n\nHave been trying to wrap my head around what this means for investors in Aker. Do they hold a share of this cash in exchange for a 5x dilution in the new joint venture company? Or is it something else? \n\nAppreciate any answers from anyone who had something similar. Details on the joint venture here: https://newsweb.oslobors.no/message/614772.",

In addition, ACC will retain NOK 0.40 billion in cash. The sum of the\npurchase price for ACCH and retained cash corresponds to a value per ACC share\nof NOK 9.19.

Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",

        "post_body": "Alphabet and Microsoft are sending a clear message to investors: AI and Cloud Computing are two industries that are paying off.\r  \n\r  \nBoth companies released their earnings, and let us tell you, they did GREAT. Alphabet surged as much as 12%, pushing their [valuation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-parent-alphabet-reclaims-spot-2-trillion-valuation-club-2024-04-26/)past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose by as much as 3.5%, which is an impressive gain for them. \r  \n\r  \n**The Main Details:**\r  \n**Alphabet:**\r\n\n* New cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, the first in the company's history. \r\n* The board of directors also approved stock buybacks of around $70 billion. \r\n* Total revenue rose 16% from the same period last year.\r\n* Earnings per share beat estimates: $1.89 vs $1.53 expected.\r\n* Cloud revenue rose 30%, and Ad revenue rose 13%.\n\n**Microsoft:**\r\n\n* Total revenue rose 17%, and Profits rose 20%.\r\n* Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected.\r\n* Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud Segment rose 21%.\r\n* Azure and other cloud services rose 31%.\r\n* LinkedIn revenue rose 12%, Xbox revenue rose 62%, and PC revenue rose 18%.\n\nBoth tech titans are locked in a battle over the dominance of the AI field, but it seems as yesterday's results show that the market thinks these two companies have room to grow together.\r\n\n**Generative AI**\r  \n2024 is the year of generative AI, and it looks as though technology that can create text, images, and videos with prompts is here to stay. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAi to challenge Google\u2019s two-decade dominance of the internet, but Alphabet's own generative AI, Gemini, isn\u2019t too far back. \r\n\nThe space is becoming competitive, with both Alphabet and Microsoft executives saying their generative AI programs are driving more business for their cloud computing services. Corporate customers are also more open to making long-term investments in cloud infrastructure, increasing their trust in both companies.\r\n\nGenerative AI is giving a reason for corporations to come back and continue to use the cloud services of their company of choice. This gives the volatile tech industry some stability, with new demand and revenue coming in for both companies. \r\n\n**Google\u2019s Trailing Cloud Services** \n\nThis new intake in demand for cloud computing is a welcome turn for Google, which has long lagged behind industry veterans Amazon and Microsoft. After breaking even for the first time last year, the unit is now viewed as one of Google\u2019s fastest-growing businesses and best bet for growth as its core search advertising unit matures. Google\u2019s cloud operations pulled off a first-quarter profit of $900 million, well above analyst predictions of $672.4 million. \r\n\n**Gemini Comeback**\r\n\nGoogle\u2019s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks it had in the generative AI consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model, formally known as Bard but now rebranded to Gemini, was criticized for answering prompts with historically inaccurate images, promoting the company to stop generating pictures and depictions of people with its software.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since that obstacle, Google has been able to turn things around with Gemini. The enterprise product has told a very different story as the professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help ensure that the content released by the model stays consistent with their brand messaging to avoid mistakes like in Q1. Enterprise Gemini can be used to produce ads, videos, and podcasts.\r  \n\r  \n**Microsoft's Domination**\r\n\nThe narrative has been completely different for Google, with domination from the get-go. Generative AI has been an avenue for enterprise clients to spend more with Microsoft. The tech company has been infusing AI into the entire core product line with its technology partner OpenAI. \r  \n\r  \nThe bet is starting to pay off as customers are adding Microsoft\u2019s AI tools to help summarize documents and generate content. Alongside the addition of Copilat, Microsoft reported a 31% climb in revenue for its Azure cloud computing program, beating analysts expectations. 7% of this increase was attributed to AI which is a big deal. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub coding platform is also gaining more traction, recording 1.8 million new customers during this period an increase from 1.3 million of last quarter. This is largely due to their AI-coding assistant powered by OpenAI\u2019s largue language model, helping programmers streamline their code, answer any questions, and even convert code from one programming language to another. \r  \n\r  \nThe company is also seeing a large intake in their AI assistance tool meant to work synonymously with their Office suite software. The new tool costs companies an extra $30 a month on top of their existing subscriptions. Corporate customers are many in number including Goldman Sachs, Ford Motors, and Ernst & Young. Microsoft estimates that roughly 60% of the Fortune 500 uses Copilat.\n\n*Btw I wanna give credit where it's due:* [*This analysis was from here*](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe) ",

I am going into my summer of Junior year in college and will be working at an investment bank making good money.  Basically, all this money I have I am not going to need for a long time and would like to invest it. \n\nI have followed the markets extremely close and invested in stocks since freshman year of high school (first stock I bought was Tesla). Unfortunately, on my 20th birthday I had my identity stolen and my Robinhood with $35,000 liquidated. I didn't lose the money but haven't re invested it. \n\nWhen I think of what to do I want safety and I think the market as a whole qqq spy type deal is too expensive and lacking near term growth (in my view but probably wrong). I like gold but don't want to put all my money in a non growing asset. I like crypto but also think that would be dumb to put more money into crypto. I am thinking about buying a condo to rent out, but I have not decided yet.\n\nThis is a breakdown of my capital and curious to hear others input. As someone financially literate, it is mind numbing and extremely dumb that I am not even in like treasury bills but I am ready to make a change.\n\nCash: $65,000\n\nStocks: $15,000\n\nRoth: $22,500\n\nCrypto: $16,000\n\nMetals: $3500\n\nWould love the community\u2019s input and I will post in the future my moves!

I think Fairfax Financial FFH.TO or FRFHF makes great sense for up to 50% of the portfolio. It\u2019s very diversified and has a good shot at 5x in 10 years. Normally, that kind of concentration doesn\u2019t make sense but your portfolio is growing fast given your savings rate. E-L Financial ELF.TO or ELFIF, for 45% makes sense. It\u2019s like buying the market at a 50% discount so it\u2019s market return + how much the discount closes. The key is the high margin of safety. If you like gold, the final 5% in Mako Mining MKO.V or MAKOF makes sense. It\u2019s trading at a 20% FCF yield before growth and they have high return plans for the cash. In a gold bull, it could 10x in 10 years. It\u2019s controlled by Wexford Capital so it has grown up supervision unlike most gold companies and there is way more leverage with operators vs the metal itself.

Also if at any point repayments are late, then impairments are recognised.

So basically if the borrower is prime and repays fully its quite simple, but subprime gets complicated as you recognise losses upfront, but they will be later adjusted depending upon what actually happens. IMO its why credit as a % of GDP is far less to sub prime since 08 as banks simply aren't as profitable. Whereas mortgages still very safe and lucrative, but competitive.",

        "post_date": "2024-04-26T08:29:25",
        "post_body": "\r  \n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR) \r  \n\r  \nStory by Andrew Bary\r  \n\r  \nWarren Buffett will be at center stage, as usual, during Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting. But investors are increasingly looking for clues on what the company will be like when the longstanding CEO and chairman is no longer running it.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire could come under pressure to break itself up when the world\u2019s most acclaimed investor exits the stage. It might decide to pay a dividend rather than amass cash, as it does today while Buffett, 93, waits for investing opportunities. Buffett can expect to face questions on all these topics and more at the annual meeting on May 4 in Omaha, Neb.\r  \n\r  \nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett\u2019s longtime friend, business partner, and Berkshire vice chairman, who died last year at 99, won\u2019t be at his side. Munger\u2019s absence will only reinforce the obvious: Buffett\u2019s time atop the conglomerate he built over six decades could end during the next few years. Even Buffett acknowledges as much, writing in November that he felt \u201cgood\u201d but was \u201cplaying in extra innings.\u201d\r  \n\n\nFor some 30,000 Berkshire shareholders expected to attend the meeting, the future will be the focus as Buffett fields questions for more than five hours in what could be his only public appearance of the year. Joining Buffett on the dais will be Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, likely tasked with the role of Buffett\u2019s successor as CEO, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, who runs the company\u2019s insurance operations. Together they will answer questions small and large: Can the stock beat the S&P 500 index? Why have share repurchases declined since 2021? Can the company\u2019s new management prove anywhere as capable as Buffett? Should Berkshire break up?\r  \n\r  \nBut really, everyone will be focused on the same thing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhether it\u2019s said out loud or not, succession is front and center on the minds of investors,\u201d says Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst.\r  \n\r  \nThere is nothing like Berkshire. It has had an extraordinary run since Buffett took control of a struggling textile maker in 1965 and turned it into the world\u2019s largest conglomerate, with nearly 400,000 employees and U.S.-centric businesses that offer one of the best reads on the health of the economy. Some of its largest divisions are the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad; Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which operates a multistate electric utility business that is one of the largest producers of green power in the country; and the world\u2019s biggest property and casualty insurer, including Geico, the No. 3 auto insurer.\r  \n\r  \nThere are smaller units, such as NetJets, the leader in private jet travel; Clayton Homes, the top maker of manufactured housing; Benjamin Moore paints; Dairy Queen; and one of the largest real estate brokerage businesses in the country. Then there is a $360 billion equity portfolio led by Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Berkshire\u2019s holdings. There also is what Buffett calls a Fort Knox balance sheet, with nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire isn\u2019t run like other conglomerates. It is unusually decentralized, with Buffett leaving key decisions at subsidiaries largely to the managers of the individual companies. He wrote in the Berkshire \u201cOwner\u2019s Manual\u201d in 2017 that \u201cwe delegate almost to the point of abdication.\u201d Berkshire has a tiny headquarters staff of 26 with no corporate counsel, investor relations, or public relations staff.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire\u2019s unusual strategy has worked. The company is expected to generate $40 billion of after-tax operating earnings this year and has a market capitalization of $880 billion, the seventh-largest in the stock market. The company\u2019s Class A stock has risen to over $600,000 a share from $20 (there have been no stock splits along the way) since Buffett took over in 1965, and holders who bought the now widely held Class B shares when they were created in 1996 have seen that stock rise 20-fold. It\u2019s one of the most widely held stocks by individuals, with some three million shareholders. Probably no other company elicits the passion and loyalty of its investor base. Big institutions have never appreciated the stock as much as individuals.\r  \n\r  \nBut will they continue to, once Buffett is no longer running the show? So central is Buffett to Berkshire\u2019s business that four or five people will take over the role that he maintained until 2018, when he delegated responsibility for Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses to Abel and the insurance operations to Jain.\r  \n\r  \nAbel is due to become CEO, which involves overseeing Berkshire\u2019s vast array of businesses and likely determining capital allocation, a critical role at the company that Buffett has performed so well for nearly 60 years. That means deciding whether to use earnings to repurchase stock, pay dividends, build cash, or make acquisitions. Jain is likely to remain head of the insurance business, while Buffett\u2019s older son, Howard, 69, a farmer and philanthropist, probably will become nonexecutive chairman.\r  \n\r  \nThen there are Todd Combs, 53, and Ted Weschler, 61, who now run about 10% of Berkshire\u2019s equity investments and probably will run the entire portfolio. Berkshire doesn\u2019t say which stocks in the equity portfolio are run by Combs and Weschler, but Berkshire watchers think that many of the smaller holdings\u2014under $4 billion\u2014are theirs. These include Charter Communications, DaVita, Liberty Sirius XM, Amazon.com, Snowflake, Visa, and Mastercard. Buffett hasn\u2019t commented on their performance relative to the market since 2019\u2014when he said they were slightly behind it since joining the company more than a decade ago. We estimate that both are probably lagging behind the market since their tenures began, given the underperformance of some of their rumored holdings in recent years.\r  \n\r  \nInvestment manager Bill Smead, who heads the Smead Value fund, would like to hear from Combs and Weschler. \u201cNot introducing Todd and Ted is an unforgivable sin. If Warren dies tomorrow, they are the stockpickers, and they have never answered or been asked a question at the annual meeting.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCombs is a key member of the Berkshire bench and could be a backup to Abel as the Buffett successor or a potential successor to Abel as CEO. Combs has a good rapport with Buffett and has experience beyond investments as CEO of Geico for past four years and as a JPMorgan Chase board member. One candidate to succeed Jain as head of the insurance operations is Joe Brandon, who runs Alleghany, an insurer that Berkshire bought in 2022.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett\u2019s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett\u2019s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett\u2019s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\r  \n\r  \nAn important question, asked or not, is what will happen to Berkshire shares when Buffett steps down or dies. They may take a hit of perhaps 5% to 10%, as longtime holders cash out and investors worry that the Buffett magic will disappear. Buffett, though, has said he thinks the stock will go up on the day after his death as investors anticipate a value-enhancing corporate breakup.\r  \n\r  \nThere\u2019s a case to be made for a breakup. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest conglomerate at a time when conglomerates have fallen out of favor, with the likes of General Electric and United Technologies having broken up in recent years. For all of Buffett\u2019s investment acumen and business smarts, Berkshire stock is about even with the S&P 500 as measured by total return over the past 10 years and 20 years, Bloomberg calculations show. The stock has returned 12.4% annually over the past 10 years, against 12.5% for the S&P 500. Buffett has said that Berkshire needs to top it over time or investors should consider looking elsewhere.\r  \n\r  \nAll the massive outperformance came in Buffett\u2019s first 40 years at the helm, when the company was smaller and Buffett had a particularly hot investment hand, scooping up big stakes in companies like Coca-Cola and American Express at cheap prices. Size, too, is an impediment to outsize returns.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett hasn\u2019t had a lot of new winners in the past decade. The company\u2019s largest acquisition\u2014the 2016 purchase of Precision Castparts for $33 billion\u2014has been a bust. Buffett has had some misses in the stock market, selling a group of financial stocks including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase in 2020 and 2021 at about half their current prices. Of course, Apple has been a huge win with Berkshire\u2019s stake, now worth over $150 billion, compared with a cost of around $30 billion. But the iPhone giant is having a rough 2024, and its stock is down more than10% year to date.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire shares look like a good bet to match or beat the S&P 500 even after Buffett leaves the scene. The stock now looks appealing, valued at 1.5 times its projected March 31 book value of nearly $400,000 per Class A share and for 22 times estimated 2024 earnings. (Berkshire is due to report its first-quarter results on May 4.) Berkshire is slightly expensive relative to its five-year average of 1.4 times book value. The stock is ahead of the market this year and over the past five years.\r  \n\r  \nBook value is an old-fashioned valuation measure but is still relevant for Berkshire because of its large insurance operations\u2014insurers still get valued on book\u2014and because it has been a historical yardstick for the company since Buffett took over.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett chooses to focus on intrinsic value but doesn\u2019t disclose his estimate of that figure. Buffett has said that book value is a greatly understated proxy for intrinsic value, although share repurchases at current prices do reduce book value, somewhat undercutting the use of that measurement.\r  \n\r  \nPost Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s stock is likely to be supported by steady growth in its earnings and shareholder equity over time. The company appears capable of high-single-digit annual growth in book value based on $40 billion of operating income after taxes and gains in the $360 billion equity portfolio. If the stock keeps pace with the growth in book value, it could show similar share price growth.\r  \n\r  \nA dividend is a good bet within a few years of Buffett\u2019s death. Why? It will help his successor disburse some of the annual operating earnings. Another reason is that investors won\u2019t be so tolerant of Berkshire holding so much cash\u2014a record $168 billion at year-end 2023\u2014without Buffett at the helm.\r  \n\r  \nChristopher Bloomstran, chief investment strategist at Semper Augustus Investment Group, wrote earlier this year that Berkshire stock could generate a 10% to 11% annualized return over the next 10 years, with annual share buybacks in the 2% to 3% range\u2014above the recent rate of 1% to 1.5%. He pegged intrinsic value at around $720,000 a share.\r  \n\r  \nUBS analyst Brian Meredith is one of the few Berkshire bulls among Wall Street analysts. He recently lifted his price target to about $722,000 per Class A share from $715,000. He sees improvement at both Geico and Burlington Northern. Berkshire is one of the most defensive big stocks in the market, given its balance sheet and earnings power. A market selloff could offer opportunities for Buffett.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett is firmly against a breakup. He argues the conglomerate structure has numerous attributes, including tax benefits from the ability to quickly make use of any big catastrophe losses at Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies. Buffett has expressed confidence in the company\u2019s future, writing last year that \u201cBerkshire has been built to last.\u201d And the company\u2019s Buffett-friendly 14-member board\u2014including two of Buffett\u2019s kids\u2014is well aware of his views.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBerkshire has been run with enormous transparency, integrity, a long-term orientation, and a culture of stewardship. It is run by the greatest investor in history. That\u2019s the present,\u201d Chris Davis, an investment manager and Berkshire board member, told Barron\u2019s last year. \u201cAs for the future, every activist and investment banker will argue that in a world without Warren and Charlie, Berkshire\u2019s unorthodox structure shouldn\u2019t persist. I think it\u2019s worth defending.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhatever the questions, Berkshire shareholders will savor the annual meeting, knowing there may not be many more with Buffett at the helm. As for the stock, many may heed the advice of Munger, who said that \u201cthey should keep the faith\u201d rather than sell after he and Buffett are gone.",

        "post_body": "**Warren Buffett or Not, Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is Built to Last**\r  \nQuestions are swirling about succession, a possible dividend, even a breakup of the company. The case for buying the stock now.\r  \nBy \r Andrew Bary\r  \nUpdated April 26, 2024, 2:25 pm EDT / Original April 26, 2024, 12:30 am EDT\n\n==============================\n\n**Article Preview:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ce018n/barrons\\_26th\\_april\\_warren\\_buffett\\_or\\_not/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ce018n/barrons_26th_april_warren_buffett_or_not/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n==============================  \n\n\n**Article Link:** https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-stock-price-warren-buffett-succession-4ab47394?mod=hp\\_HERO\n\n\r  \n==============================  \n\n\n**Quote**:\n\nBuffett\u2019s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett\u2019s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett\u2019s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\n\n========================================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Think about it, how would appl, Goog, Ford, Kellogg, etc be profitable if they offered 14% of their value up a year? They're going to pay billions in cash a year? That dividend will be cut over the years % wise and that high yield is likely from a couple highly profitable quarters, not indicative of long term growth.",

The only stakeholder, who would benefit from that is China by ensuring the regional plant remains to be the global export hub.

However the useless CEO has been kicked out which makes this a potential recovery play IF a new good CEO is found that does the following:\n\n- Stops wasting capex on poor ROIC projects like small games and other stuff\n\n- Focuses their investment on fixing Payday3 and making it actually something decent.\n\n- Immediately cancels the Dungeons and Dragons shit IP they have bought (really they should focus on multiplayer shooting games only...)\n\n- Shuts down the third party publishing business\n\n- Fires 50% of the team\n\nThis is kind of similar to Meta in 2022, investors were pricing in zuckerberg just continuing to act like a robot and throwing money down the train at VR.\n\nIf a good CEO is found it's possible this could change.\n\nWhat the new CEO needs to do it fire a bunch of people as soon as they join and streamline the company.\n\nThe issue is they have an interim CEO who was an old board member and looks useless as well to me.\n\nThe question is, how much is the Payday brand still worth after they fucked up Payday3 SO badly?\n\nPayday3 only has 200 concurrent players now, whereas Payday2 has 17k. Even though it's an old title it still retains huge numbers and will still generate profit with more DLC.\n\nThoughts? I think this all depends on the new CEO but this looks like one of the situations where it probably can't get any worse given they have no debt, new potential management and cash on hand IF they get a good perm CEO\n\nI think this is worth putting on a watchlist and waiting if a new CEO comes in that isn't an idiot.\n\n>**The Board of Directors of Starbreeze has appointed the current board member Juergen Goeldner as interim CEO of Starbreeze, taking office with immediate effect.

One reason could be the reduced housing starts this year compare to past years.\n\nHere is a google sheet with the date of both companies:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\\_WpshSYBc2Y8-uZWsrJRPAy63DFUkKhF12TJhHfvFc4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTell me which would you invest in, if the share price were to drop and offer you a good entry price?\n\n(disclosure, i have a tiny tracker position in SSD)\n\n&#x200B;",

Fastenal is paying out the bulk of its free cash flow as dividends, the dividend ratio is approaching 70% and it has been growing its dividend at a rate of 12% a year for the last 10 years. In fact, Fastenal just made it to the Dividend Aristocrat list, companies which has increased its dividend every year for the last 25 years.\n\nI look at the slowing growth of Fastenal and the need to payout so much of the earnings to dividends plus the need to increase the dividend annually as quite stressful when compared to Simpson Mfg, where the payout ratio is only 30% and the annualized dividend increase is about been 7%. \n\nBottom line, SSD has got more potential upside to be rated at a higher multiple than FAST whereas for Fast, if the business slows down too much, and they cannot increase their dividend, the stock will fall quite dramatically as the dividend investors move elsewhere.\n\nDo you agree with my assessment ?",

I expect more share repurchases to be announced with earnings, which should continue to help juice EPS.\n\nI'm not understanding why the market is ignoring the massive share repurchases the company continues to do. Apple bought back ~1.5 billion shares in the past three years alone, having spent:\n- $82.6 billion in 2021\n- $89.6 billion in 2022\n- $79.2 billion in 2023\n\nLast quarter they ended with $173 billion in cash/marketable securities versus $108 billion in debt. The CFO reiterated the long-term plan to go cash neutral. So with a net cash position of $65 billion, I expect Apple bought back a significant chunk of shares in Q1 and might even be a record for share repurchases last quarter.\n\nI know iPhone growth isn't encouraging, but services continue to grow at a double digit clip. With the share repurchases and healthy growth in services, why isn't Apple trading at a higher multiple? To me it seems like a deep value play relative to the other mega cap stocks and a no brainer to buy and hold. \n\nWhy is the market relatively so bearish on Apple?",

Its P/E may be high, but so is Costco whose P/E is twice that of Apple.\n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of people will disagree with this example, but I think my point still stands\u2026 Apple is so ingrained in the culture and has such a strong brand identity\u2026 that a P/E ratio of 25 makes it a value play.\n\nAlso\u2026 don\u2019t give me any of that bs about teens being fickle. If teens today feel iPhones are aspirational, they\u2019ll feel the same way as adults. There are plenty of examples from history that illustrate this.

I also think it trades OTC in the US as well, they are most known for being the publishers of hotline miami.\n\nThey IPO'd 2.5 years ago and have crashed since because some of their games flopped and previous management didn't do so well. They had a huge 2022 net loss due to impairment which means they invested a lot of money into some really poor games.\n\nWhat's interesting about them is they have:\n\n* No debt\n* A lot of cash\n* A terribly low share price\n* Management has very large stakes in the company and is incentivzed\n* New management is the original founders who made it successful in the first place\n* A back catalogue such as cult of the lamb which continues to produce them decent revenues\n* Most importantly they have some upcoming games that could be big hits, Human Fall Flat 2, Plucky Squire (my personal favourite, it looks similar to 'It Takes Two', Baby Steps (made by the creator of 'Getting Over It' which is massive), Anger Foot (I have played the demo and it's really really fun, the soundtrack is amazing) etc.\n\nManagement has delayed the above releases to make sure they invest in them correctly so they are big hits like cult of the lamb was, i.e they need to hit an 85%+ on Metacritic and 'very positive' reviews on steam for a game to really have a chance of being big.\n\nDevolver digital are well known for high quality games.\n\nSome potential risks:\n\n* They need to stop acquiring any more companies or they run the risk of destroying value by overpaying, although most games companies are at all time lows to be fair.\n* They have to make sure the above games are hits, if not their stock price will tank even further.\n* The stock is very illiquid, it's very hard to buy so put small limit orders in if you do decide.\n* Games companies are a bit like gambling with the odds on your side, they have lumpy revenues and need hits to keep growing, obviously if these games flop it's a disaster.\n\nHave a look into it\n\nThanks",

        "post_body": "Hello all! I'm a college student who got into value investing around 2020. I've slowly been learning more as I go along, and I'd like some opinions on my portfolio\n\nDIS-40%. This is easily my biggest investment, and for good reason. The business itself has survived through multiple financial crisis, multiple leadership crisis, and a global pandemic, and is now in a state where they can fully take advantage of the market. Their park business is one of the best businesses out there, with a great moat, solid earnings, and great margins. The linear business has shown resilience in the face of cord cutting, the DTC business is really beginning to show its fruits, and could be a real driver of growth. Even if Disney+ fails, worst case, they can make a lot bidding their content away to the highest bidders on streaming, with players like Netflix, AppleTV, and Prime Video bidding the content price up. IMO, this is still very undervalued for how good of a business it is. \n\nINTC-16.5%. Another great business. Their revenue and earnings slowdown mainly come from a global demand shortage for consumer CPUs, which will begin to pick up in the future. Pat Gelsinger has proven to be a great CEO while at VMWare, and the business is currently priced as if the revenue growth will only come from the foundry business. The foundry part of the business has been operating for the entirety of Intel's history losing money, it's only that now that it's independent of the CPU arm that people are focusing on it. Worst case, they spin off the foundry business and become fabless. With their connections, strong revenue, and overall dominance over the CPU market, that business will still prove to be extremely strong. \n\nTCEHY-13%. This is less a bet on China and more a bet on Pony Ma and his investment acumen. Pony Ma has proven himself an extremely good executive, and with the vast, diverse, strong, and high margin business that spans international markets, this is a great business to buy. China is easing restrictions and wants foreign dollars again, which is proving itself in a recent semi-rally in Chinese stocks.\n\nCVS-10.5%. This is the business I'm the most likely to sell. I bought in because the revenue growth and overall business seems strong, but they bought a lot of that revenue growth, and the regulatory environment has turned SHARPLY against them. It seems increasingly likely that their core business will get attacked by competitors, and leadership at the company doesn't exactly spark confidence like other companies do. Increasingly seeming like a value trap. \n\nSOFI-10%. This is less of a bank and more of an overall financial stock. It's proven to be a great grower, and the company was trading at its TBVPS, so I bought in. Leadership knows what direction they're going in, and understand exactly how to funnel customers into their pipeline. \n\nBABA-8.5%. Another China bet. This comes from the overall strength of the balance sheet, the share buybacks, and the potential that BABA has in the cloud and international markets. I'd hope to see Jack Ma be allowed to come back to BABA, but that's unlikely. Still, with China easing restrictions, this company is increasingly seeming like a company people can actually invest in again. \n\nWMG-1%. This is more of a temporary percent. I plan on buying more in the future, but it seems like the price has been falling, so I'm waiting for more of an entry. Robert Kynci is a great executive and really helped to make YouTube what it is today. They are embracing tech more than any of the other large labels, and the business is in a state of really transforming towards the modern music market, while the other 2 major labels remain a bit stuck in their ways. Music is also an industry that is likely to see rapid growth based on the growth of Vinyl, streaming, and overall merchandising of artists. Data has continually shown that Gen-Z spends significantly more on experiences and wants to support artists, which provides a great opportunity for WMG. Don't let the temporary metrics stray you away from this business, as it's a great opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if the percentages don't add up. I'm rounding a bit with this. Thanks for free opinions here.",

Your analysis of DIS shows nothing the market does not already know - outsize positions should be reserved for those with a hidden something the market is yet to discover\n\n3. Your INTC analysis has \"great business\" and \"slowdown\" within a few words of each other. Nowhere in your analysis is any discussion of the reliance on subsidies to prop up and \"grow\"\n\n4. Your TCEHY analysis is confused: you say it is a bet on Pony Ma and end up discussing China's need for dollars? You'd be better off talking about how you think they'll monetise WeChat, how they'll meet the challenge of TikTok, how they'll leverage gaming to boost their cloud business. If I was betting on leaders like you are here, I'd be one of the funds bag holding Twitter with Elon right now\n\n5. CVS analysis focuses on the risks - why? Because the share price is down 20% recently? If you're investing in single names you need to do what Buffett did at AMX in the face of the salad oil scandal: understand the risks and understand what the market doesn't and buy it when it's down 50%. Your analysis shows me you'll be selling low and buying the next boat that's already being pushed by a rising tide, rather than buying the one that's beached and patiently waiting for the tide that's about to come in\n\n6. Your bullish view of SOFI means you don't discuss its purchase of banks (you criticise acquisitions elsewhere) nor its risk due to Biden's action on student loans (you mention ss a negative the regulation changes facing CVS, but not here?). You are betraying your biases. Investing should be done in a very cold way, applying the same standards everywhere. What are the risks facing this company? Why isn't it making money consistently? You don't answer the basics. Better off in an ETF that invests in the theme you bought this for. \n\n7. BABA is \"another China bet\" - I thought you said TCEHY wasn't a China bet? Again, your spitting what everyone knows: cloud, international. Surprised you didn't mention AI. If you want a China theme, you can get it via an ETF, but by punting in two names you're taking a risk of unknown proportion. You might come back in three years and your 22% in these two names has doubled and is now 30% of the portfolio. You'll be patting yourself on the back, and wondering why they aren't 44% of the portfolio seeing as they doubled...\n\n8. You're betting only 1% of your portfolio on WMG? which is trading at about 20x EV/EBITDA? This is so out of character: with that level of ovevaluation I'd expect this to be at least 20% of your portfolio\n\nI'd be liquidating everything and investing in low cost thematic ETFs. Find one for streaming (DIS, WMG), find one for China and Emerging Markets (TCEHY, BABA), find one for fin tech (TCEHY, SOFI), find one for healthcare (CVS), funds one for semis (INTC). That's five so 20% in each. And next time you see a company you like, find an ETF for it and make sure it's not an already existing theme in your portfolio and trim your existing winners to invest in the new one. Keep doing that until you have enough ETFs that don't duplicate risks. Rebalance regularly, trimming winners and adding to losers. \n\nYou asked for free opinions, and these only cost 2 cents.",

Lots of people are doing this on YouTube or TikTok. Disney et al used to have a huge market because of a lack of options.\n\n2. Word of mouth matters far more than marketing. The advantages of being a huge corporation rather than an indie studio in terms of getting an audience in has shrunk\n\n3. Audiences are far more aware of which movies are OK or good from social media and avoiding them in theaters and waiting for streaming. They are only going to movies that their friends rave about.\n\n4. There is growing international competition in entertainment and we are all now aware from various pieces of media that audiences are open to Korean or Japanese cinema and TV. Much of this seems to be made more efficiently than hollywood.\n\n5. The parks depend on producing great work, great characters and stories that resonate. Disney is failing to do this.",

I do like the SOFI pick a lot, better margins then any brick and mortar bank and their tech revenue is expected to grow 100% yoy, Monday will be a big day for the company as continued profitability imo is essential for the near term outlook on the stock, do find it very undervalued at this price, especially with Noto\u2019s 2026 projections.

Every entertainment company is pumping out garbage. Warner Bros had a crapshoot with DC. Many of the other entertainment companies haven't produced much notable. Yeah, Disney's recent slate has sucked, and they've certainly done a poor job with the film IP of Star wars, but guess what? That's all temporary. Those are things that are incredibly easy to fix. And Disney executives have recognized this, and are actively making shifts. Disney understands that they'll need to begin production of original IP, or pull from other source material(like WB with Dune), and eventually they will.

        "post_body": "\n**Key Insights:**  \nFLIC has shown remarkable resilience during major financial crises, including the 2008 global financial meltdown and the recent 2023 turmoil in the regional banking sector. Despite these strengths, its stock has been overlooked and is currently trading at levels similar to those seen in 2008-2009. When getting into the weeds you'll see FLIC has tons of liquidity, zero doubtful rated loans on the books, rock solid dividend yield and history, insiders consistently buying shares, corporate buy backs, owns the real estate of at least 20 of their 40 branch locations (in NYC/Long Island), upcoming earnings (after the bell today) and dirt-cheap options (low volume though so be careful).\n\n* **Aggressive Buybacks:** With a continuous $15 million buyback program and hefty insider purchases, there's a clear signal that those in the know believe in FLIC\u2019s future.\n\n* **Affordable Options:** The options market for FLIC is invitingly priced, providing a cost-effective way to potentially profit from future stock movements, just be careful as they are low volume typically. Hopefully we will see an uptick with earnings today.\n\n* **Proven Stability:** FLIC has navigated past financial storms with strategy and grace, bolstered by recent tech upgrades in fintech and cybersecurity.\n\n* **Financial Health:** Solid capital ratios underpin its ability to maintain operations and seek growth, enhancing its appeal as a robust investment.\n\n* **Attractive Dividend Yield:** For those looking for reliable income, FLIC\u2019s strong track record of dividends is a major draw, especially if you\u2019ve been burned by riskier bets this week. At first glance the yield at nearly 8% may appear unsustainable but when doing you DD you'll see that it is a sustainable number and the stock is just cheap at the moment.\n\n* **Valuation and Earnings:** Given the ongoing buybacks, insider enthusiasm, and strong fundamentals, my target price of around $17.40 based on a P/E of 15 and an EPS of $1.16 seems achievable for this stock before the end of the year. FLIC's annual report pegs the book value at $16.83/share which you can see in their SEC filing and I believe once the regional banking sector rebounds FLIC will get right back to $17+. \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFLIC\u2019s blend of strategic buybacks, insider confidence, and significant movement on small volume, alongside its solid financials and undervalued options, make it an intriguing prospect for those looking for a mix of safety and growth in the financial sector.\n\nBut bottom line: it's undervalued and the company has been around 100 years.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is for informational purposes only, not financial advice. Always do your own research or consult a professional.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 290 Shares\n* 10 \u2013 9/20 $10 C\n* 5 \u2013 12/20 $12.50 C",

Taylor Swift eras tour, the APE saga where he raised money through issuance even when shareholders didn't want to let him etc.\n\nReasons for pause:\n\n* It has a massive, unsustainable debt load - 4.5B total, of which \\~3B is due in 2 years. They will need to refinance, but the terms will likely be onerous.\n* Liabilities exceed assets by 1.8B, so the company is basically at the mercy of the senior lenders\n* The writers' and actors' strikes did a number on box office revenue for at least two quarters - so far\n* Management has no qualms raising money through share issuance, which has diluted shareholders down the drain (\\~20X over 3 years).

Operating Income is different from EBIT, and therefore my intuitition tells me that using one or the other has consequences for the later valuation process with, for example, companies that have a significant amount of earnings from non-operating activities investments or credit lending. Is this correct?",

Also assume all asset is worthless by the end so nothing to salvage. \n\nEg. First year $100K rev >> $90K EBITDA >> $77K EBIT >>> $69K EBIT after wages >> $55.2K NOPAT >> $50.2K present value NOPAT\n\nEg. Second year $90K rev >> $81K EBITDA >> $68K EBIT >> $60K EBIT after wages >> $48K NOPAT >> $39.7K present value NOPAT\n\nI got fair value for the business at $215K. Saw from another comment that\u2019s pretty much what you paid so you didn\u2019t really get anything from the deal, at least from my quick calculation.  Well I suppose you personally get a $8K annual income from this for 15 years, which assuming at no tax and a 10% discount rate for simplicity has a NPV of $61K.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I assume the D&A is effectively equal to maintenance capex.

While Buffet likes to say be greedy when others are scared most of their holdings are about steady businesses with earnings staying power.  During the Subprime meltdown he did special deals with Goldman and BofA - as mentioned already with loans that converted to stock at a preset price or preferred shares or warrants that accomplish the same.  There are other examples but o believe these are all one offs and not the core investing approach BRK practices.  \n\nThere are several books on Buffett\u2019s essays and the letters to shareholders.

        "post_body": "I originally viewed TDM as a plantation Group with a healthcare arm. About 17 years ago, the healthcare segment only accounted for about 16% of the Group revenue. The Group plantation operations then was mainly in Malaysia and this accounted for a large part of the Group\u2019s revenue. \n\nThe Group decided to expand it plantations segment by venturing to Indonesia. It took several years to get this going such that the maiden revenue from the Indonesian plantation was only in 2013. By then  the Group had \u201c..earmarked that the growth of the plantation operations will be in Kalimantan.\u201d \n\nBut things began to go wrong with the Indonesian operations soon after. The losses and impairments got so bad that the Group announced its plans to sell the Indonesian assets in 2019.  By 2023 it was still trying to complete the sale of its Indonesian assets. \n\nIf not for the healthcare segment, which had grown to account for 56 % of the Group\u2019s revenue in 2023, TDM would be in a worse shape.\n\nMoral of the story? Beware of companies announcing expanding into foreign countries as the Malaysian experience may not always be transferable. \n\nGiven the poor plantation segment performance, the market took a dim view of the company despite a growing healthcare segment. I guess the market is still waiting for TDM to prove that it can recover from the Indonesian lesson. \n\nRefer to \u201cIs TDM a value trap?\u201d if you want to bet on its turnaround. \n\n[https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more](https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more)",

        "post_body": "(Downvote if you do not want to see this type of articles. Do not downvote because you do not agree with the article)\n\n**A Value Investor\u2019s Guide to Navigating Technology Disruption**\n\nBy Mark Iong\r \n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/value-investing-technology-stocks-s-curve-40230f6a?mod=djem\\_b\\_Weekly%20Barrons%20feed%20for%20last%2024%20hours\n\nTectonic shifts occur more frequently in technology than in other sectors, so investors need to be wary of tech companies that are approaching the mature stage of what is known as the S-curve.\r \n\nThis curve, shaped like the letter \u201cs,\u201d is a visual representation of the growth path that technology companies tend to follow. It begins with slow initial growth (the bottom of the \u201cs\u201d) then moves with rapid upward growth as adoption takes off, finally arriving at the plateau stage, at which businesses become increasingly commoditized, growth becomes saturated, and returns trend lower. Companies in the plateau stage of the S-curve often find it difficult to recapture their momentum, particularly in the tech sector, where megatrends tend to be irreversible. Consider the evolution of computer technology from mainframes to PCs and servers, to mobile and the cloud\u2014each development a paradigm shift that didn\u2019t reverse course and that rendered the previously used technology less favored and eventually obsolete. With artificial intelligence, a similar seismic shift is now under way.\r\n\nAs value investors, we naturally gravitate to the uppermost section of the S-curve. Quality companies often become undervalued by the market at this stage, providing the opportunity to buy at a significant discount relative to their long-term intrinsic value. But we need to be highly selective, identifying businesses that have the competitive moats and defensive characteristics that will extend the upward slope of the S-curve into the new technology frontier instead of entering the plateau stage.\r\n\nBy contrast, mature tech companies risk succumbing to the \u201cinnovator\u2019s dilemma,\u201d a term coined by the late academic and business consultant Clayton Christensen to describe how companies cling to their established markets and protect profit margins instead of focusing on innovations that might disrupt their core businesses but also open up new opportunities for growth. As new entrants exploit this complacency and carve out a niche in the market, legacy businesses eventually fall victim to a shrinking profit pool, as capital flows to new entrants that offer products with more power, efficiency, scalability, and affordability.\r\n\nWithout innovations to alter their weakening fundamental outlook, the old guard may see profits dwindle and their valuations deflate. It is a slow bleed, a value trap that lulls investors with seemingly cheap metrics but masks a bleak future. We feel it is important to avoid these long-term secular losers that might seem statistically cheap based on today\u2019s valuation. A company trading at a depressed price-to-earnings multiple, for example, could be \u201ccheap\u201d for a reason, reflecting a declining business where valuation could remain low indefinitely or worse, continue to compress.\r\n\nThere are several important traits we look for when evaluating maturing technology businesses. They need to be innovative with an eye toward the future, developing new products and services that can position them for the next paradigm shift. Management needs to be willing to disrupt themselves, even if doing so risks revenue and earnings losses in the near term. We witnessed several companies created in the early days of the internet, for instance, that successfully navigated their way into mobile computing in the 2010s and are now attempting to repeat the same playbook as they make strides in the AI era of the 2020s.\n\nPlatform companies are probably the best examples of businesses that are most adept at steering through disruptions. Such companies have an extensive ecosystem of first-party software and hardware products and third-party partners that rely on their platforms. Cloud computing exemplifies this dynamic today, where several players control the majority of the market and are essentially the gatekeepers for all things artificial intelligence and cloud computing. In technology subsectors such as semiconductors and enterprise software, we seek those firms with durable business models and robust product road maps that can serve as the foundational layers of the next megatrend.\r\n\nTechnology companies primed for long-term success understand that disruption is a marathon, not a sprint. Conversely, those that struggle to adapt and innovate are the ones most likely to stumble. Value investors who recognize this could be primed to take advantage of outperformance in the tech sector. \n\n============================\n\n&#x200B;",

        "post_body": "* Cormedix (CRMD) is a biotech company that primarily focuses on the prevention of Catheter Related Blood infections with their leading product, Defencath. Catheter Related Blood Infections plagues the End Stage Disease Population. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease Institute, nearly 808,000 people suffer from this ailment, and approximately 69% are on dialysis([https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:\\~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)))\r\n* Defencath is a catheter lock solution that eliminates both gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections that develop within the Catheter. Defencath is composed of a solution of taurolidine and heparin that effectively reduces the CRBSI events in this vulnerable population.\r\n* However, this population has a catheter that is surgically implanted into their patient and its called a, \u201cCentral Venous Catheter.\u201d This type of catheter is placed near a large center vein most commonly an internal jugular or subclavian. In layman terms, it\u2019s placed near the patient's heart, implanted on the patient to administer medication or to administer hemo-dialysis.\r\n* The results of their Lock-100 Study had 71% reduction in CRBIS compared to the control (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37678222/). Additionally, They rejected the null hypothesis by a P value of .0006 to such a degree that it would only occur in 1 in 10,000 tries due to sheer random chance. Therefore, the phase III study was halted.\r\n* There are approximately 250,000k CRBIS events per year according to this site,([https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:\\~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019))\r\n* You can check the company\u2019s most recent deck to see the potential impact of Defencath on CRBIS here, ([https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation\\_1-7-23.pdf](https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation_1-7-23.pdf))\r\n* **As of November 15, 2023 Cormedix received a NDA Approval by the FDA for the limited population of Adult patients affected by kidney failure**( [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/#:\\~:text=About%20CorMedix&text=DefenCath%20has%20been%20designated%20by,address%20an%20unmet%20medical%20need.)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/#:~:text=About%20CorMedix&text=DefenCath%20has%20been%20designated%20by,address%20an%20unmet%20medical%20need.)))\r\n* **As of January 30, and April 9th 2024, Cormedix secured CMS J-Codes for In-Patient and Outpatient settings**.( https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-and-reimbursement-updates/) and ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/))\r\n* **On April 19, 2024, Cormedix Also Secured TDAPA reimbursement from CMS for the Out-Patient Setting**([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/)).\r\n* Lastly: on April 15, 2024, Cormedix Celebrated their commercial launch for the in-patient setting, and expect to lauch out-patient by July 1st 2024.

Additionally, other insiders have not sold any shares over the past few years. I heavily weigh insider ownership whether they were paid for, awarded, or granted in lieu of payment. You can see all insider activity here, ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/insider-activity)).\r\n* T**he institutional ownership** acquired about 33.94% of total shares on the open market with Black Rock Inc leading with 3,507,695 Shares held as of 12/31/23. Numora Holding Inc, comes in second at 2,946, 552 shares, then Vanguard at 2,825,335 million shares, and lastly Elliot Investment Management L.P., comes in at 1,550, 523 million shares. See all institutional ownership here, ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings))\r\n* Y**ou\u2019re probably wondering at this point, how does Defencath work, and what are the Projected vials to be sold?** Cormedix projects to sell 3.4 million vials on the inpatient side and over 37 million vials on the out-patient side. The growth potential is HUGE!\r\n* **With such volume you\u2019re probably wondering at this point how precisely does the product work\u2026** Well, Every Time a patient receives hemo-dialysis the catheter must be flushed with the Defencath solution before and after. That is approximately two vials per patient per visit with the average patient getting about 3 treatments per-week, out of 550,000 patients on hemodialysis.\r\n* Cormedix plans, and is on track to launch Defencath for out-patient setting on July 1, 2024.\r\n* Cormedix Plans on expanding its usage and application of Defencath to other populations that already have CVCs, like Oncology.\r\n* The current short interest as of 3/31/24 is 34 million dollars or approx. 8.2 million shares.\r\n* **Marketing Plan**: There are 5 major companies that control the out-patient setting, and two of them control 70% of the market. Remember, Out-patient is projected to sell appx. 37 million vials!\r\n* The Projected market impact of the stock is incredible, and understanding the product shows the extreme value it holds.\r\n* **Debt:** the company has NO debt.\r\n* **Market Exclusivity:** CRMD has 10.5 years market exclusivity because it's a qualified infectious diseases, and it's a new chemical entity. And it\u2019s intellectual property is extended until April 15, 2024. See ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/))\r\n* **WHY WILL CRMD EXPLODE SOONER THAN ANALYISTS EXPECTATIONS?**\r\n* The out-patient setting is dominated by 5 major out-patient facilities, and once it received it's NDA every medical Journal posted the NDA approval AND JOE, MENTIONED THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING TO BOTH IN-PATIENT AND OUT PATIENT FACILITIES AT March 12th Earnings Call \"March 12, 2024 \"Joe Todisco, CorMedix CEO, commented, \u201cI am excited about the Company\u2019s recent progress as we have scaled up activity ahead of our commercial launch in April. **We have received significant inbound interest from both inpatient facilities as well as outpatient dialysis providers with respect to DefenCath, and we are actively engaged in customer discussions in both settings of care**\" ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:\\~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)))\r\n* **Competition:** There is no Drug on the market that prevents CRBIs the way Cormedix does and there is absolutely no competition.\r\n* The CTXR guys will say we\u2019re competition but we\u2019re not. Mino-lock salvages an already infected Catheter. It\u2019s a reactive medicine opposed to Defencath which is Preventative.\r\n   * The preventative application allows for such high sales values in such an exclusive market.\r\n* **CREDIT TO Fretwizard125,** \u201cGood post and summary of what\u2019s in play here. I\u2019ve been in CRMD since 2018 and Have been accumulating. Have a multi-hundred thousand dollar position and am waiting for this to explode. With TDAPA we could see 70-80% market penetration really quickly, (1-2 years).\r\n   * The Wholesale Acquisition Price FROM CRMD and approved by CMS is $250/vial. They will likely offer discounts to the providers to adopt and recognize revenue too. But even with a 70% discount for a vial potential revenue is insane.\r\n   * Quick math $75/vial x20,000,000 vials (50% penetration) =$1.5b. Yes billion, with a B.\r\n   * This does not include other indications they are trying to expand into including oncology and TPN. Oncology market is 1.5x the size of hemodialysis. This is a long term hold with literally the most perfect commercialization setup I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d--- Credit to Fretwizard 125\r\n* Projected Price: Low $9.00 per share, medium is $12.00 per share; high of $19.00 per share within the next year. I believe we\u2019re going to hit the 9s in july and potentially hit 20s before December.\r\n* **TLDR:** Cormedix(CRMD) Is Deep Value. It hit\u2019s all of the marks. CRMD is poised for huge growth over the next year, reaching over a billion sales. The market is unique, and they\u2019re going to be the standard of care. The stock is primed to explode at any day. I believe the stock will be at least 25$ per share by March 2025 if not $35-$40 per share. 5 Major companies control 100% of the out-patient market. They\u2019ll be announcing contracts in the coming weeks. I think we can hit 12$ before the out-patient launch in July, that\u2019s my opinion.\r\n* **All RISK IS ELIMINATED!**\r\n* **POSITION:**\r\n   * 50 call contracts $6 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K Exp. June 21\r\n   * 50 call Contracts $7 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K exp June 21\r\n   * 3750 Shares average $4.15. (have a little bit of higher average because of options trading throughout the past 3 years.)",

I don't know about the USA, but in my professional experience by far the most people with end stage renal disease have an arteriovenous shunt, and NOT a catheter. Having a (central venous) catheter is usually just for temporary dialysis, or as a bridge to getting a shunt or a peritoneal dialysis catheter (which is not a central venous catheter).

That\u2019s one way a person can get CRBIs.\n\nThey also have a CAP to seal the catheter to prevent things from getting in.\n\nHowever, the catheter still must be sanitized between each hemodialysis before and after.\n\nSo that\u2019s where Defencath replaces Heparin because it\u2019s 21% more effective; and defencath targets both gram positive and negative bacteria as well as fungi\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that many of these companies develop product specific solutions, and that regardless of caps, and patches biofilm will still develop within the catheter which is why defencath is necessary.\n\nLastly, again, Mino-lock is only used after a Catheter is already infected. So if Defencath fails then mino-lock is used.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions in these products ensures understanding the deep value cormedix holds with their Defencath CLS (Catheter Lock Solution) .\n\nEdit...

Most people don't understand how certain securities work like bitcoin or Ethereum but invest in it all the time.  \n\nMoreover, had you read the DD, you'd realize that they have 10.5 year exclusivity plus another TPO for intellectual property until 2042.... Yes, had you double checked the DD and the sources, you'd realize they have enough money to break even via their expectations this December.  \n\n>  \nThere's just so many unanswered questions that only someone who's seen hundreds of similar scenarios can answer, which I doubt most people on reddit have the ability to.\n\nOkay, so what, we're going to gate keep stocks, because we don't have faith in people to do their own DD, with a starting point? I believe more speech is good speech. And people can decide for themselves if they want to invest in CRMD.  No one is being forced, influenced or fooled into buying this stock. I'm sharing an opinion and people can take what they want from it. Buy, not buy, or forget about it, or wait then buy.... It doesn't matter, but as I'll say it again, more speech is good speech why gate keep speech?",

        "post_body": "Hello,\n\nI wrote up an article that provides a framework for evaluating and comparing quality compounders like Hershey using key metrics and analyzing long-term trends in the financials of the business. By interpreting financial data visually in the key areas outlined below, we can more easily identify businesses with the potential for sustained growth and value creation over the long term.\n\n* Price and Volatility: Understand the risk profile and market perception of a company\n* Income Statement and Balance Sheet: Understand the company's earnings, assets, and financial health.\n* Valuation: Assess the value of a company relative to its peers and industry.\n* Return of Value: Explore a company's strategy for returning value to shareholders.\n* Industry Comparison: Benchmark a company against its direct competitors. \n\n [How Hershey Can Be Your Golden Ticket for Evaluating Investment Opportunities](https://quartest.substack.com/p/how-hershey-can-be-your-golden-ticket-90b)\n\nI have been developing this financial framework for analyzing stocks for quite some time now and thought you all might be interested in it. I would also greatly appreciate your feedback on the analysis and my writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR Summary of my Hershey Analysis:\n\nHershey's consistent revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth have historically warranted a premium valuation to the market. The financial strength and resilience of the business have consistently placed Hershey as a top performing in the consumer staples sector. These returns have been well justified, as Hershey has continually demonstrated efficient uses capital, as evidenced by its high return on invested capital, equity, and assets. Its attractive return strategy, including dividend payouts and share buybacks, have provided a sound value return for shareholders.  \nHowever, Hershey has recently been faced with perceived challenges in maintaining sustainable earnings growth in an inflationary environment with skyrocketing cocoa prices and tough competition from snacking rivals. While Hershey's five-year historical EPS growth lags behind some competitors and has recently slowed, its valuation has potentially come down to reasonable levels given the quality of the business and its strong cash flow generation. Nevertheless, Hershey's ability to navigate external factors including  market dynamics and further cost fluctuations in its inputs, will be crucial to the company's long-term success.\n\n",

Combinations of several factors over several years leading to an amplified outcome. \n\nPlants were not replanted in 2020, and there\u2019s been mismanagement in governments of growing regions in Africa. So you get 1 in a century rainfall last year with El Ni\u00f1o impacting global weather patterns and that was the catalyst. Now you have some regions with swollen shoot disease in 30% of crops. They\u2019ll still produce but have very low yields until replaced. This is in large due to the fact that there\u2019s been aging plants out there not replaced as they should have been.\n\nThere\u2019s other regions in the world such as South America where cocoa comes from to begin with, that have suitable growing conditions. There\u2019s also climate controlled solutions which would take more capital but remains an option.\n\nAdditionally, at 11% cocoa use, Hersheys chocolate is 1% above the legal threshold to call it chocolate. This also gives them a low cost advantage on their peers. Boutique chocolate goes about 40%-60%. Cadbury is 20%+, M&M\u2019s Mars flagship chocolate is about 20%. Anything semi-sweet is in the 30%+ range.\n\nThere\u2019s a variety of hedges Hershey has in regards to cocoa. This commodity supply crunch isn\u2019t their first rodeo. They\u2019ll do just fine in the long run with plenty of levers at their disposal to deal with this short term noise.",

Moreover it is an \u2018orphan crop\u2019. Much of the capital is not put into growing it as the farmers are often poor smallholders (or medium sized ventures which may or may not rely on slave labor) with little capital and the big companies just buy through intermediaries anyway. So all the capital is downstream from the growing, so to say. This, plus the fact that a grower can\u2019t move his land uphill as the climate warms, is all very stratifying.

However, it's not suitable for the majority of retail investors.\n\nI generally wouldn't recommend active stock picking for most retail investors. The more you learn about it, the clearer it becomes that active investing isn't the best strategy for the majority. Instead, retail investors should focus on passive investing through diversified ETFs, understanding risks, diversification, and proper portfolio or asset allocation. Most importantly, they should get to know their own investor behavior.\n\nUnderstanding one's risk tolerance and creating a long-term, sustainable investment strategy that one can live with is crucial. For those still keen on learning about stock picking, it might be wise to limit this to about 5% of the portfolio. This can help mitigate the risk of capital loss while still allowing for significant learning outcomes in comparison to their broader market portfolio.\n\nI emphasize passive investment because there is strong empirical evidence showing that the market outperforms 80-95% of institutional investors after fees over any 10-year rolling period. This trend is even more pronounced over longer periods.",

        "post_date": "2024-04-22T08:03:02",
        "post_body": "This week, I feel compelled to acquaint those unfamiliar with Benjamin Graham, the cornerstone figure of value investing. \n\nRegarded as the \u201cFather\u201d of this discipline, his seminal works, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, serve as indispensable guides for investors. Graham\u2019s principles laid the groundwork for the legends of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and continue to inspire legions of aspiring investors.\n\n>  \u201cThe intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\u201d  - Benjamin Graham\n\n# The Teachings of Benjamin Graham\nGraham imparted numerous invaluable lessons, but today, I wish to highlight three that I consider pivotal for enhancing one\u2019s investment acumen:\n\n## 1. Invest in the company, not the share price\nWhen we purchase just one stock of a listed company, it is no different from buying the entire business. That one share gives us ownership rights of the company, including a proportionate share of the company\u2019s profits. So we are NOT buying a share but rather a company.\n\nIt may seem like I am stating the obvious. Yet, even today, people trade stocks because of their volatility rather than the underlying fundamentals of that business, and even \u201cinvestors\u201d quickly overlook the basics of a company because they don\u2019t want to miss out on the latest trend.\n\nWhile there are stories of success trading stock and people retiring early because of  \u201cthe next big thing,\u201d there are far more stories of going broke due to the same strategies. Unfortunately, those stories are seldom in the media, posted on social media or spoken about over the dinner table.\n\nIf we want to be successful investors, we must understand the company we are buying, how it generates revenue, the costs to run it, and the risks involved. The more we know, the more confident we will be when we invest, and although that doesn\u2019t guarantee success, it dramatically improves it.\n\n## 2. Invest at less than it is worth.\nGraham, being an investor during the Great Depression, was always acutely aware of the risks of investing in the stock market and how easily fortunes could be lost. Therefore, he believed in investing with a Margin of Safety, which means buying shares in a company at a discount to its true worth or intrinsic value.\n\nIn Investing Chronicles above, we discussed the historical average P/E of the S&P 500, which is around 20.5, meaning that, on average, the price of the S&P 500 is roughly 20x the combined earnings of its constituents. If we assume this is the fair value of the index, then whenever the index is trading below 20x earnings, we have a margin of safety. The lower the P/E, the greater the margin of safety.\n\nSimilarly, for a company, once we have analysed the business and its economic drivers, we should be in a decent position to derive an estimate of its intrinsic value. If we believe the company to be worth $100 million and the market currently values it at $150 million, why would we purchase shares?\n\nHowever, the opportunity is evident if that company has a current value (market cap) of $75 million. More importantly, buying it at $75 million provides us with a safety net because our calculations might be off (almost guaranteed they are), and the company\u2019s actual value could be $80 million. Of course, the actual value could be $120 million, but you get the point!\n\n## 3. Let the Market Come to You\nBesides \u201cMargin of Safety\u201d, Graham is also famous for coining the term \u201cMr Market\u201d, referring to the bipolar nature of the stock market.\n\nIn the stock exchange, as with all things involving human beings, emotions get involved, and one could argue that when money is involved, we get highly emotional. The higher the emotional charge, the higher the capacity to act irrationally.\n\nEuphoria will likely occur when share prices appreciate and money is made. Market participants throw caution to the wind during these times, feeling nothing can go wrong. As a result, investors overpay for assets. We can see this currently, at least in my opinion, as certain tech stocks are valued as though the stars have aligned.\n\nOf course, the opposite is true too, when fear takes grip. During these times, irrational, pessimistic market participants convince themselves that they will lose all their money and sell while running for the hills, screaming, \u201cThe sky is falling\u201d. During these times, valuations can plummet to illogical lows.\n\nOur goal is to remove our emotions when investing.\n\nInvesting in the long term is a fantastic strategy because it allows us to ignore short-term market noise and fluctuations, especially if we understand what we have bought. We are in a hugely advantageous position to take advantage of Mr Market, buying when fear is at its peak and selling to the overzealous buyer.\n\n# Summary\nSo be more like the Father of Investing:\n\n- Know what you are buying,\n- Know what it is worth, and\n- Only buy it when you can get a substantial discount.\n\nIf you can master the above, you are well on your way to being better than most.\n\nHope you enjoyed this.

But even if he did and I\u2019m not aware, you also have to take the context of the P/E into account\u2026.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked at it but let\u2019s say you are correct about historic P/E being at 20x. Okay. But that was before companies were buying back shares (and retiring those shares) like crazy. That means there are less shares of quality companies to go around. While in a vacuum the P/E should not change with shares bought back, you aren\u2019t considering the DEMAND for those shares staying the same or even increasing. There are plenty of research papers arguing that due to the prevalence of share buybacks we may be entering a world where higher P/Es are standard, at least for a while. \n\nAlso, I would say that China\u2019s current low P/E is NO indication of \u201ccheapness\u201d but rather of lack of quality and higher risk.",

So when you buy directly comparable companies at 20x multiples vs 30x multiples, and the price falls for both, you're more likely to lose more money on the 30x multiples company than on the 20x multiples company simply because you can assume a baseline at constant earnings.\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the company's earnings being stable - a company with volatile earnings cannot be measured like this.",

If 2 companies in the same industry have dramatically different valuations, then there's usually many reasons for that difference. It could be very well the case that the lower price multiple company is more risky during a time of duress. For example, jp morgan vs all the smaller/medium sized banks in the last couple of years.\n\nThe value principle here is that by taking on more risks in those lower price multiple companies, you also raise your expected return.",

Nvidia has been nearly alone on the field, with more than 90% market share.\r  \n\r  \nBut fresh competition is coming\u2014from companies big and small\u2014and the battle will be fierce. The stakes couldn\u2019t be bigger: Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has sized the AI chip market at $400 billion by 2027. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That\u2019s almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.\n\n. . . . . . \n\nA few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make\u2014or, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.\r  \n\r  \nHuang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren\u2019t the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well\u2014or better\u2014than Nvidia.\n\n. . . . . \n\nNvidia\u2019s rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won\u2019t be winner-take-all. It isn\u2019t game over. It\u2019s game on.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia\u2019s most obvious challengers are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\n\n. . . . . . . ",

Add on the current conflict and split opinions the impact of GLP-1s on their business, they may struggle for some time.\n\nRegarding interest rates, their products are largely financed when purchased. The selling price in the US is about 2-2.5x that OUS. Payback periods are quick based on an ASP of $130k but high rates are still deterring purchases. Lenders have also been slower in lending. INMDs clientele are also not wealthy. Average income of $60k. They are sensitive to higher interest rates.\n\nGeopolitical risk will be there for some time but the US being right off the coast should keep things from getting out of control. All 3 of INMDs primary manufacturers (outsourced) are in Israel. They have a buffer from the borders but Israel is so small that it may not matter much if things do escalate. GLP-1s in my view are not an issue. Overall, it should boost demand.\n\nLaser-based products have an installed base of 40-50k in the US. IMND was at around 7.5k at the end of 2022. INMDs products do the same things as lasers (for what they market them for), but better. They are finding new indications (ENT, Ophthalmology, Women's and Men's health) to increase their TAM and have a pile of cash they will have to do something with.

A metric like return on equity ROE is advocated by Buffett and I believe Mulehkamp.  ROIC  by Joel Greenblatt. ROCE by terry smith.\n\nOthers like Charlie Munger/Buffett, Chris Browne (or Tweedy Browne) also consider consistency of results as part of quality.  A Munger quote I like is one where he says that if someone were to approach him about a company with a great future but doesn\u2019t have a track record, he will send the person on his way. \n\nI screen for quality first, then put the stocks on a watchlist and wait until they become cheaper to own.\n\nBy quality I look for consistency of results and return on equity. Specifically, past five year of revenue and eps each year better than the previous year. And in the last 5 years, roe as a minimum of 10. I also exclude banks (as they are almost always have > 10 ROE)",

Otherwise, if your intention is to invest with a long time horizon (5+ years), I\u2019d strongly recommend the majority of qyour portfolio being a couple broad, low-cost index funds \u2014 VOO is a terrific choice.\n\nYou can explore the various options for ETFs using a tool like [this fund screener](https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-screener).\n\nIf picking stocks, you should be able to explain your thesis to someone. You should also be aware of the company\u2019s fundamentals. This takes time and effort, but is essential. I would strongly recommend listening to earnings calls: They provide important insights into a company and its leadership. The Quartr app is a great tool for this.\n\nEDIT: I see you invested in some of these companies because they pay a dividend. Might be worth reading up on the considerations. See [this article](https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-stock-dividend) on how it is not free money, and [this one](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082015/3-biggest-misconceptions-dividend-stocks.asp) on misconceptions.",

If that doesn't appeal to you, just go with something straightforward like VTI or VOO. Try to keep individual stock picking to no more than 5% of your total investments.\n\nAs a beginner, it's easy to make expensive mistakes and challenging to consistently outperform the market over the long term. Don't take my word for it; there's strong evidence showing that simply holding onto market indices beats 80-95% of managed mutual funds over a decade, and the results are even more pronounced over longer periods.\n\nAt this stage, you likely don't have the expertise needed to effectively manage the risks associated with picking stocks. It's better to grow your wealth passively and maybe experiment with a small portion of your portfolio to get a feel for the market. This way, you minimize potential losses, which saves more of your capital for investing once you've mastered the basics and developed a solid strategy.\n\nPicking individual stocks is tough. It involves a deep dive into financial reports, understanding business models, analyzing fundamentals, forecasting growth, and estimating the true value of a company. This process requires a lot of reading, a solid grasp of financial principles, disciplined effort, and considerable time.

This wide adoption underpins consistent demand for ARM\u2019s products and innovations.\n\t2.\tStrong Financial Performance: ARM recently exceeded analyst expectations, posting adjusted earnings of 29 cents per share on sales of $824 million against expected earnings of 25 cents on sales of $762 million. This beat suggests robust financial health and operational efficiency. Year-over-year growth with earnings rising 32% and sales increasing 14% further bolsters the case for a bullish outlook.\n\t3.\tPositive Future Guidance: ARM forecasts continued growth, expecting adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share on sales of $875 million for the current quarter. This guidance surpasses analyst predictions of 20 cents on $779 million in sales, indicating confidence from ARM\u2019s management in the company\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\t4.\tTechnological Advancements and Market Expansion: ARM is benefiting from the shift to its higher-value ARM v9 technology, gaining market share in strategic areas like cloud servers and automotive sectors. The growing importance of AI also drives licensing growth, as more devices require ARM\u2019s efficient compute platform.\n\t5.\tTechnical Analysis: Although not always predictive, technical indicators can provide insight. ARM\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at the lower end on daily and weekly charts, suggesting the stock might be oversold and potentially poised for a rebound.\n\t6.\tIndustry Trends and EPS Rating: The semiconductor industry is set to grow with advancements in AI, IoT, and mobile technologies, all of which rely heavily on ARM\u2019s architecture.

That's a 20% increase year over year in SAAS revenue, so it's growing rapidly.\n\nThey've lowered prices on their cameras to drive up the number of cameras in hand. They are pushing to deploy more cameras for a larger subscriber base.\nAll that said. They are currently undervalued, and the there are over 6 million shares sold short.

Here's what I see.\n\nPerformance:  \nRevenues are dropping (Speeding up the decrease in revenues YoY), while COGS is increasing.  \nBasically, all margins are dropping.  \nNI are negative.  \nROE and ROIC is decreasing while growth is decreasing too. A clear sign of losing market share and edge.\n\nMost recent year's FCF was -1.03 (in millions) in comparison to -177. But thats because their investment in Marketable and Equity Securities granted a positive 123. Meaning that the increase of FCF wasn't because of their performance but their invested securities (sometimes people miss this, and just assume FCF is getting better because of operations. In this case, its clearly not).\n\nPerformance is quite crappy, losing competitive edge to others. Valuations do, however, look cheap and some positives  \nP/S 0.26x  \nEV/EBITDA -8.04x  \nnegative P/E (isnt all that great but ye)  \nHuge cash holdings\n\nTheir asset base has a big goodwill that accounts for roughly 15% of their asset base (which im not a big fan of).  \nChecking insider history thru openinsider, GPRO is currently facing a sell-off by insiders (not only investors). Never a good sign. \n\nThing is, no matter how undervalued it may be if the company continues to lose its ground (rev dropping, margin dropping, competitive edge dropping, no innovations), the stock will never recover since there is no beginning catalyst for the future. Remember, valuations are based on future expected performance.\n\nLooking at your post, there seems to be potential turnaround catalyst regarding the SAAS transition which may bring revenues up and running again. One thing I learned however is that its very dangerous to grab a falling knife only to have two of your fingers cut off. Especially regarding turnarounds, your catalyst story must come to fruition, before you invest your money into it meaning the knives have to be laid flat on the ground.\n\nWhen investing on turnarounds, positive FCF is a big deal for me. No matter how undervalued it may be, if there are growing negative FCF it means the company is losing money and having to take money out of their own pockets to keep the company afloat. Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill) invested in GME greatly in part of its positive FCF which signals overlooked value. But looking at GPRO, it seems to be relying on a single revenue stream revenue turnaround which accounts for 10% of total revenues.\n\nI'd say wait a bit to see if your analysis comes to fruition then invest. As of now, the stock doesn;t seem that great of an investment to make in my personal opinion. I may be wrong however, but if theres one thing for sure its a risky play.",

Personally I like to see a little bit more stabilization of the books. Looks like an okay play off the 52 week low. Regarding the moat I don't think there is much of one. I used to use GoPro's quite a lot to capture my sporting footage. They work well and are good for the time being. Eventually I just grew out of it and only use it sometimes. I do know my friend uses 3 of them for his youtube fishing vlogs and they are well used in a lot of sporting scenarios. Without a subscription I am able to capture footage, upload to my computer and edit videos or pictures with no capacity limit. The subscription apparently provides regular users to obtain discounts in the future and some other perks. Basically it's a call option with a 1 year expiration date hahaha. I like gopro personally as a camera I can use to capture pov footage, I would not purchase the subscription myself. However if subscription users do continue to climb that would become very investable in my opinion.\n\n-EFP",

If they can\u2019t fix these issues, then other companies who made their products better will continue to eat their lunch.  \n\nI wanted to keep liking GoPro but they keep disappointing in the hardware space.

Here are my considerations:\n\nWhile the total assets per share (before liabilities) is $6.31 much of this is in intangible assets. Removing intangible assets (except for accounts receivable) brings the total down to $4.99.\n\nOf these tangible assets many of them are highly specialized and only hold value because they can be used to generate revenue. If a business fails, its specialized assets might not be valuable to others and therefore hard to sell. If GoPro fails its inventory can be reasonably assumed to be worthless, lowering its salvageable assets to $4.29 per share. I do not know the details of the company's property and equipment or other long term assets so I am not subtracting them.\n\nTotal liabilities per share are $2.69, subtracting this from the salvageable assets we get $1.60 of salvageable book value per share. This is just slightly below the current market price. While the company is currently cheap considering its assets I'm not sure how long it has to turn around its operations being both GAAP and cash flow negative. While book value might make many companies seem undervalued, it is important to consider whether or not this value will actually be realized. Benjamin Graham stressed the importance of assessing the quality and margin of safety provided by a company selling below its tangible asset value.",

Despite a loss of $53 million, their investment in R&D shows commitment to innovation. The growing subscription revenue and strategic pricing adjustments indicate a shift towards sustainable growth. While facing challenges from market trends, GoPro's potential as an undervalued gem is hard to ignore.",

Meaning that the increase of FCF wasn't because of their performance but their invested securities (sometimes people miss this, and just assume FCF is getting better because of operations. In this case, its clearly not).\n\nI mean, dude, for somebody that's basing capital allocation decisions on historical free cash flow.......I hate to break it to you, but you're not calculating free cash flow correctly......\n\nIt *looks* like you're just taking CFOps (or EBITDA or OpInc -- doesn't make much of a difference as all are proxies for operating cash flow) and backing out the **total** cash flow from investing (including the onerous ~$150mm in money market funds maturing....) -- that isn't correct.\n\nFree cash flow is **really** a measure of how much cash you generated for the period (from core business activities) that could conceivably be distributed to your capital providers - hence why it's traditionally calc'd as [Cash Flow from Operations less Capex](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/fcf-formula-free-cash-flow/).\n\nNot sure why you're backing out the full amount (including the huge cash inflows from short term debt instruments maturing into cash) from CF Investing, since -- just judging by GPRO's balance sheet and Statement of Cash Flows over the last ~12ish quarters -- it looks like they took the huge ~$325mm windfall in operating cash flow they generated during their COVID boom during FY 20 and FY 21, dumped the vast majority of it into money market funds, and have been drawing on ***that*** to meet their working capital requirements (aka v bad news as both a capital allocation decision for you and as a going concern for GPRO).\n\nTL;DR: GPRO didn't generate -$1.03mm (which, tbh, I'm not entirely sure how you're backing into this number....) in FCF for 2023A......its really closer to -$34mm (2023A OCF of -$32.86mm less $1.52mm in capex spend during the same fiscal year)\n\n\nAlso, the way you calculate free cash flow is ***always*** Cash Flow from Operations less Capex",

Once you hit product market fit, you flatline R&D and drive growth through S&M which is the 'variable cost' for SaaS companies as sales reps/AEs make commissions on ARR quota. \n\nBefore evaluating their success as a SaaS company, would need to know: 1. software gross/contribution margin (ideally 80%+ as cost base is hosting costs), 2. Are they rule of 40 (at this stage in their lifecycle they should be - they're not at $500mm in ARR), 3. ARR trend by cohort (i.e. gross/net retention rates and trends), 4. Historical S&M spend and sales efficiency (ideally >1x), and 5. qualitative aspects like sales cycle length, cloud based vs. on-prem (i.e. stickiness of customer base - feeds into retention), target market (SMB vs. enterprise), etc. (there is a lot more like LTV/CAC but this is what a SW PE firm like Vista or Thoma would care about).\n\nProfitability doesn't matter so much - these companies trade on a revenue multiple, and this early in the growth cycle you have a deferred revenue flywheel (e.g. for example 1-yr. Subscription contracts paid in cash up front) and if sales efficiency > 1x, you want to plow everything back into S&M. Better not to be comped by investors to profitable SaaS as you're trying to scale.\n\nI'd be scared about their well capitalized competitors in the cloud space too but that's a separate conversation..",

GoPro used to have an edge in the Drone scene, especially FPV, but now DJI sells transmitters and camera kits that can provide better footage and considerably better transmission footage than that of typical FPV cameras.

I've used GoPros for a long time and never once paid for it and maybe using the Quik app once. Not needed.

They are burning through cash while returning nothing to shareholders (their buybacks just cover the $40m in dilution from SBC per year).\n\nHis point is highly relevant. If you've got management that has a controlling stake that they refuse to give up/sell, they can burn through all their cash, then engage in death spiral financing to keep the lights on. This can reduce the company value to zero just to postpone the inevitable.\n\nA recent example of the top of my head is Bed Bath and Beyond. Even after it was abundantly clear banruptcy was inevitable, management decided to engage in death spiral financing to keep the lights on for a mere 3 months. The cost? A 10x dilution and such a heavy deterioration of their asset value (mainly through cash burn) that even the bond holders are likely to end up with nothing.",

I don't think the company is as worthless as DJT but there is non zero chance it can go bankrupt since it is burning cash like hell with no profit in sight.\n\nWell what do you know, it went up 10% today because it got slightly better delivery figures for this month.  I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  I am losing faith in what I am doing in trying to find value when I could just tag along early on some hype stock and make so much more.\n\nCan anyone convince me the errors of my way before I totally fall to the dark side?

Many of these funds don't do value investing because they have investors who get impatient. This triggers redemptions and firms can subsequently lose a lot of money.\n\n> but for retail investors that look at the stock market all the time trading on hype should bring more returns?\n\nThis is a very short-sighted view. Yes, it may work in certain instances but trust me you will be burned badly especially if you're using real money.\n\nYour situation is basically a textbook reason as to why Buffett and Munger preach patience and rationality.

To understand bitcoin, all you need to know is three things:\n\n1. Bitcoin is a ledger Money is essentially a ledger with certain properties that make it ideal for trustless interaction.  Bitcoin is becoming money. Gold and silver used to be money.   The monetization of a new mathematical and technological discovery from zero to everything will be shocking and volatile. This is a network effect, look at the historical bitcoin price in a logarithmic format. For bitcoin's investment thesis to play out and hold water, it should start to gradually demonetize gold, silver, real estate, and even stocks. Our current financial system has successfully demonetized gold to an inconsequential amount. It is debatable whether gold is still money. For more on money, read Broken Money by Lyn Alden.\n2. Bitcoin is money, not currency Money is not currency, money is a means of storing and communicating value. Money is a system that makes trust not necessary between two strangers. Learn the properties that make good money and apply them to bitcoin. Currency can be a secondary layer on top of base-layer monetary policy. In my view, credit and currency are adjacent. Think of Bitcoin as digital gold and then discover the benefits of digitizing gold.\n3. Bitcoin can only happen once\n\nBitcoin got a special start that gives it an unbeatable moat:\n\n* Benefit of low-oversight for many years\n* Fully verifiable ledger with small file size\n* Worldwide distribution and adoption across completely different societies and economic landscapes\n* Beautifully engineered system that adapts to participation- read about difficulty adjustment.\n* Monetary policy ensure by decentralization\n* Ledger secured by energy- read about proof of work.\n* Pseudonymous founder that disappeared for long enough to let bitcoin develop on its own without central leadership (even if he returns, I see it as a non-issue, but this is debatable. He likely won't return)\n\nThis is why people often use the phrase Bitcoin, not crypto. Because crypto refers to a speculative ecosystem, while bitcoin refers to a digital asset with a strong track record with over 11 years of 100% uptime and 99.9882% uptime over its 15 year lifespan (including the early years with very few network participants)\n\nIf you don't agree with this, its fine, you simply won't adopt bitcoin *yet.*  I personally think that the incentives are aligned for this technology to continually surprise disbelievers and make idiots appear as geniuses.\n\nMy **not financial advice**: own a little bitcoin.  It seems more risky to own 0 than some.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso a thought about value investing. We are not in an macroeconomic environment that favors value investing currently. I think seeking value is great way to develop conviction about a company, which is definitely a leg up for investing. Value investing is a slow process though, its not going to make you rich in the span of a single year. It might not even be a five year thing. Ten years though? Maybe. Twenty years? More likely. Fifty years? Sure.\n\nIf value investing makes you rich right away, I wouldn't call it value investing- maybe a contrarian bet would be a better term. Sure, you could get lucky and time a good value pick.",

Restaurant chains and fast food chains are piling up, the mall is always full, walmart & costco are ridiculously overfilled to a point you can barely walk around. Obviously it's a small % of all those businesses but I see no worries in a small city of 65,000. \n\nBut whenever I look at the market, read online or listen to people around it is filled with skepticism and very bearish sentiment. Not only from everyday people but from CEO's of American companies or hedge funds managers. Though I'm not too familiar with him I heard (see link) a gentlemen named peter schiff mention he was getting away from us dollar and had 50% of his wealth in Canadian gold stocks and only invested out of the dollar. A lot of hedge funds I keep an eye on seem very bearish, like mhonish pabrai investing in auto repair / auto parts companies and coal (I understand the coal move being more so geopolotical). Other managers like seth klarman, ray dalio, guy spier and other famed investors also hinted towards this same sentiment, though not as extreme. \n\nI also listened closely to Jerome Powell today and I did not hear anything that seemed overly worrying, unless I missed something? And yet the first comments or videos I came across after were about stagflation, recession and a total economic collapse.\n\nSo is it really as bad as what people say ? Why is seemingly everyone so worried ? What am I missing ? If it really is as bad as what people say why is the auto industry or food in expansion mode at such a rapid rate? \n\nAlso if things really are that bad why are all these professional investors still in the market ? If someone has a clear conviction of a economic collapse of some sort, why not wait and buy companies for pennies on the dollar? ",

        "post_body": "I was doing %100 discretionary macro before I found this 4 years ago. I like macro and it comes easy to me, but it was always stressful  and I wanted a strategy that brought more peace but still had high returns. I searched every corner of the internet and stumbled upon this. Very few people will listen, and most will mock me, but this post isn't for them. This post is for the old me that was searching for answers and was ready to change and get started on a solid foundation for fundamental analysis by following the example of some of the greatest of all time. Ok here we go!\n\nThe go-to strategy for most people is a low cost index fund. The idea behind this is called the Efficient Market Hypothesis. This idea says that all publicly available information is already reflected in the price of all financial assets. Under this idea, the only way to beat the stock market is to have insider information and to be doing insider trading, because insiders have insider information that is not yet available to the public. Once that information goes public, the information becomes useless.\n\n\nWhat people don't understand is that in order for markets to be efficient, there has to be liquidity. Take Apple stock for example. Apple has about $10 billion dollars a day in trading volume, meaning that everyday $10 billion dollars worth of Apple stock is traded on the stock market. This liquidity is what makes it possible for new information to reflect itself in the price without friction. The liquidity allows for a large number of people to analyze the stock and buy and sell freely. Large investors need this liquidity and cannot invest in assets with low liquidity. The richer a person becomes, the smaller their universe of stocks becomes, because they need stocks with more and more liquidity. If a large number of people cannot invest in a stock because it is illiquid, then the possibility opens up that the stock could become inefficiently priced.\n\n\nWhat makes the strategy possible is the \"illiquidity premium\". The stock market can be divided into several layers depending on the size of corporations. There are (in descending order), Mega Caps, Large Caps, Mid Caps, Small Caps, Micro Caps, and Nano Caps. The smaller we go, the more illiquid the market becomes which allows for more opportunity to find stocks that are trading at \"inefficient\" prices. However, our chances don't really go up until we get to the nano caps (companies traded below $30 million dollars in market cap). The people investing in nano caps are individual investors and maybe some boutique investment funds because nano caps are too illiquid for large players. As far as I know, there are no nano cap ETFs or mutual funds because they cannot handle the illiquidity. There are some micro cap ETFs and mutual funds however.\n\n\nNow we know what pond to be fishing in, but we still don't know how to fish. We need a strategy that:\n\n#1: Requires no skill, and is accessible to anyone who can do basic math.\n\n#2 Doesn't take a lot of time.\n\n#3 It should be conservative because we want to keep our money safe.\u00a0\n\n#4 It should also have a return significantly higher than a broad stock market index because, if it doesn't, then what is the point?\n\n\nDoes this strategy exist? Yes! It is called the Net-Net strategy and it is the highest returning quantitative strategy that I know of. It was invented by Benjamin Graham, who was Warren Buffets mentor. Warren Buffet himself used the strategy for the first 20 years of his career. He stopped using the strategy because he eventually ran into liquidity issues.\n\n\n\nThe Strategy:\n\n\nThe best way to introduce it is to use an analogy. Imagine someone has a really crappy car. It still runs but the wheels are about to fall off, the paint is chipped and it's making a bunch of noises that are a sure sign of trouble. Could this car be a good investment? Surely not, since it is going to get sent to the scrap yard at any moment. But what if the owner offered to sell it to you at a %50 discount to its scrap value? Now it becomes an attractive investment because we might be able to sell it above its scrap value, since it is still running after all. But if we can't, we can drive it over to the scrap yard, double our money and ride back home on public transportation with a wad of cash in our pocket. Makes sense right?\n\n\nTake that logic and transfer it over to corporations. The idea is to buy stock in corporations trading below their scrap value. If you were to buy a stock like this, and the next day the management announced the company will be liquidated, you would make money.\u00a0\n\n\nThe formula for finding the scrap value is to add up all the current (liquid) assets (cash, inventory etc...) and subtract all liabilities. The result is the Net Current Asset Value (NCAV). This is a generic formula for finding the approximate scrap value of a company. The fixed assets (real estate, factories etc...) are ignored and considered as a cherry on top. The most thorough way to find scrap value is to find the liquidation value of the fixed assets as well, but this takes time and the generic formula is good enough. Simple right? It might sound intimidating if you have never heard accounting terms but trust me this is as easy as it gets. If you can operate a can opener, then you can do this basic formula.\n\nIf the stock price has a %33 or more discount to NCAV, it is now a candidate for investment. But first it has has to meet 7 more criteria before we invest.\u00a0\n\n\n#1 It needs to be an operational company. Seems obvious but if you aren't using a screener, or have a crappy screener, you have to check to make sure it's not just a shell corporation. We will talk more about screeners later.\n\n\n#2 Is the company owner operated? Why should I have a stake in the company if the management doesn't have a stake in the company? This is actually considered optional by most people doing this strategy but I consider it mandatory, except in special situations. I like to see that the CEO owns at least 5 years salary worth of stock. I also like to see the CEO buying stock on the open market but that doesn't always happen.\n\n\n#3 The company needs to have a current ratio\u00a0 above 1.5. A current ratio is a fancy way of calculating if the company has an emergency fund for a rainy day. They need to have enough liquid assets to cover short term liabilities. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities.\n\n\n#4 The company needs to have a low debt to equity ratio (D/E). This is a simple way to check if there is too much debt. Too much debt could bankrupt a company. First we calculate the equity by adding up all assets and subtracting all liabilities. This is the Net Asset Value (NAV). I like to strip out intangibles and goodwill to calculate Net Tangible Asset Value (NTAV or NTA), but this is optional. Once we have the equity (NAV), we divide the total liabilities by the equity. Some people only divide the long term debt by the equity. We want the D/E ratio to be %50 or lower. Statistically, companies with %20 or lower have had the best returns.\n\n\n#5 The company needs to have a low burn rate. Generally when companies are trading below scrap value, they are experiencing problems that are hopefully short term. They are generally going through a period of unprofitability. Since they are not able to meet all their expenses from selling product, they may rely on their emergency fund to get them through the tough times. However, we need to see that they have control of their expenses and that they are not burning through their emergency fund too fast. We check this by tracking their NCAV through time.\n\n\n#6 The company shouldn't be diluting shares. Another way companies can get cash to make it through the tough times, is to sell shares in the open market. Most people running this strategy do not tolerate any share dilution.\n\n\n#7 The company should have been profitable in the past 10 years. If the company has already been in trouble for over 10 years and they haven't fixed the problem, then the company might be dying. We want companies\u00a0facing short term problems, not long term problems.\n\n\nThat's basically it. How has the strategy performed? It returns ~25% per year. Don't believe me? Here is a link to a few independent studies:\n https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/why-and-how-to-implement-a-net-net-investment-strategy-world-wide\n\nSince the strategy is quantitative in nature and doesn't require investment skill, it can be backtested and many backtests have been performed by different people.\n\n\nSince this is a statistical strategy, we want to hold 20 stocks at a time to protect ourselves from single stock risk. The stocks are held for a year and then whatever no longer fits the criteria is sold and replaced. The losers are sold before the year end and the winners are sold after a year end to maximize tax efficiency.\n\n\nOkay so now that the strategy is explained, we have to actually find these stocks. Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett had to comb through thousands of stocks by hand, but we live in modern times and we no longer have to do this. The way to find the stocks is to use a screening tool. The screen searches through a financial data base of stocks and pulls out all the stocks trading below NCAV. A high quality screener will also screen for the 7 things I outlined, except for insider ownership,\u00a0 that you have to do yourself. With a high quality screener, I can just pluck 20 stocks from the screen and buy them. I don't have to do any calculations or further research. If I have a crummy screener, I will have to check everything myself.\n\n\nIf you have a good screen, the only work is actually buying and selling the stocks. Since the stocks are illiquid, there is usually a large spread between the bid and ask price. You will have to learn how to place your own limit orders and it could take weeks to get your orders filled. So there will be work in managing the portfolio. Getting locked into investments from illiquidity is not a problem. I am in contact with several people running the strategy and getting locked into an investment\u00a0 has never come up in conversation but it is technically possible, especially if you have a lot of money. But in general, if you are able to buy the stock, then you will be able to sell the stock. The strategy becomes difficult to implement once the investor has $5-$10 million dollars. Once you get over $5 million, you may have issues buying and selling and you will get locked out of the strategy eventually. This is what happened to Warren Buffett. Once he got locked out, he had to adjust his strategy and became the investor he is today.\n\n\nThe reason why you have never heard of Net-Nets is because nobody has a financial incentive to tell you about it. Wall Street is not going to tell you about it because they cannot package it into an ETF or mutual fund to sell it to you. Rich people are not going to tell you about it because they can't focus on it (because of liquidity). Maybe your financial advisor would tell you IF they were competent. But as we all know, they are not competent, which is why we fired them and bought an index fun instead. This strategy has fallen into obscurity because markets have become so efficient, but it is still used among a small group of people in the most inefficient stratum of the market, the nano caps.\n\n\nThat about wraps it up. I want this information\u00a0 to get out there because I want to see you succeed in your financial goals. I just happened to stumble on this, but if you don't tumble down the right rabbit hole, you will never find out about this. But now you have! Knowledge is power.\n\n\nCheers,\nCharlie",

The past few years the strategy has handily beaten the market but this year the strategy is basically flat while the broad market is doing well. I dont use stop limits.

As far as value traps, i would say, as long as the assets have merit, then it is hard for it to be a value trap. By merit, i mean the assets can be useful to other competitors in case of a buyout or liquidation. On the other hand, if the inventory is filled with some obscure or obsolete thing that nobody wants, could be a value trap. Or perhaps the fixed assets are super niche capital goods for the oil industry for example, that could make it not worth much in a liquidation scenario. To do this strategy, going abroad is necessary. Right now all the best net nets are in Korea, Japan and Singapore. There are some in Europe. There is only one that I know of in the United States.

I agree there are reasons why this stock isn't at ATH's and won't be getting there soon, but at what price is this company fairly valued at in your opinion? I don't see many other decent sustainable dividend payers with growth potential. \n\n\nI have to think history will look at Phyzer for $25/share as one of the most overlooked mega cap stock in our time. Existing revenue is good enough to limp the company along for awhile, and servicing debt isn't as challenging for them versus other competitors. One big hit on oncology research could be a new source of revenue for decades to come, bringing the share price back to more historical averages or much higher. \n\n\nLastly, this is more a personal theory than numbers based. The rise of dividend investing and value seeking is inevitable as many people retire and/or are reducing some risk after the latest tech boom. Advisors across developed countries will be looking for steady, dependable opportunities moreso than the next Blockchain or AI craze. The return of inflows to value stocks in general will help support the share price. \n\n\nIt's all a pretty bullish on my mind. Few companies have a history of stable dividends, a bit of a moat due to market cap and existing specialty products, and the potential to double their share price in a short amount of time.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of 51 cents a share on revenue of $13.87 billion.\n\n\u201cWe delivered strong performance in our non-Covid product portfolio in the first quarter of 2024,\u201d Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a press release.\n\nRevenue for the quarter declined 19% from the prior year, driven by a drop in sales of Comirnaty, the company\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine, and Paxlovid. Comirnaty revenue of $354 million declined 88% while Paxlovid revenue of $2 billion dropped 50%. Pfizer said that excluding the impact from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenue increased 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe company now expects adjusted earnings in 2024 of between $2.15 to $2.35 a share, compared with prior guidance of $2.05 to $2.25 a share.\n\nShares of Pfizer were rising 2% in premarket trading Wednesday to $26.14. Coming into the session, the stock has dropped 11% this year.\n\nPfizer shares fell sharply in December when the company set guidance for 2024 that was billions of dollars short of what investors had anticipated. The company reaffirmed that revenue guidance of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion when it announced earnings in January and again on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note published earlier this month previewing the quarterly report, J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott wrote that he doesn\u2019t expect Pfizer to raise its 2024 guidance until the company knows more about how Covid-19 vaccine and therapeutics sales will shake out for the year, a number that depends largely on how the virus spreads.\n\n\u201cWe believe stronger new launch performance and/our further progress on the pipeline will be necessary to change the current narrative on the stock,\u201d wrote Schott, who has a Neutral rating on the stock at a target price of $30.\n\nThe company has had some good news in recent weeks. In late April, the Food and Drug Administration approved Beqvez, a gene therapy to treat patients with hemophilia B. It is the first Pfizer gene therapy to receive regulatory approval in the U.S.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com",

                "comment_body": "TPL- Seems like an interesting play. Not that dependet on oil prices compared to an integrated producer. Their cash flows seem to decrease when oil price goes down but they are more stable nontheless. I've just looked into an investor presentation and it is indeed intriguing.  \nI like that they offer some water treatment services and in general the diversified revenue streams. This is the kind of company which needs at least 2 weeks of research to throughly understand. Probably reading the last 5 10-K.\n\nI'd probably see how much acrage they own, calculate the royalties per acre, see which of those acre have water which oil royalty rights. Then add in the predicted future royalty growth and you've got yourself a valuation. You've probably done this and found a lot of value. They also have no debt which is desired for this type of business model.\n\nSome risks might be if their assets, the acres, are really high quality or not and how much value can actually be extracted to justify the 30ish P/FCF. Also if oil companies can hit on their margins if the oil price should crash. Maybe also some environmental regulation in which they might have to cut margins together with the oil producers. Couldn't find any big risks with my very quick not-thorough analysis. Also would be interesting to know how they recognise their revenues and also how the contracts to oil producers are constructed.\n\nIn general I see a lot of political backwind supporting the Permian, and the Permian oil extraction will just keep on going as long as there won't be a climate crisis.\n\nACIC - Can't give you a lot of value on that one as I'm still learning insurance. But renewal rate looks good, ROE is damn high. Would be interesting to see how they invest their float. Those special insurers can be a good value play. The thing is though, they insure catastrophe events in Florida. Might be a bit risky, but I don't know, can't give you any value on this one.\n\nCLPR - They own mostly residential real estate, which in NYC is good and still has loads of value. I don't like the offices though. I think long term office space in the west won't reach the value it had before the pandemic. It depends how much of the AFFO comes from this. They might be trading at a discount due to this but you probably already looked into this. In general, looking alright.\n\nSTRT - Damn this one is really cheap. Also i like the locks MOAT. Don't think that OEM will change these kind of supplier relationships. Maybe others like wheels, but locks not really, considering the margins are quite low already. They are exposed to some auto industry seasonality. In general might be the chepeast one out of the calls so far.\n\nLILAK - They are producing around 300M FCF on a 1,5B Market Cap so that's value there. In general teh LatAm market is growing, so is the need for data. Good thing that they divested the B2B transit. You can pretty much see that instantly in the margins. The debt looks managable to me. Not a bad value play also. Cheaper then comparable industry peers.\n\nCool picks, you made me intersted in some. I'll look further into some. If you want to maybe discuss some further go ahead and DM me and try pitch me. Maybe you can see if your thesis is really defendable or not.\n\nGo ahead an check my YT channel to maybe find some other bigger Market Cap plays: [https://www.youtube.com/@BanjoLid725](https://www.youtube.com/@BanjoLid725)\n\nGood luck with your fund, I strive to do this one day too!",

You can search for the company name and filter the results by \"Past Employees\" to see profiles of individuals who used to work there. Keep in mind that not everyone may have their employment history listed publicly, but it's a good place to start.\n2. **Social Media**: Sometimes, former employees may mention their past employment on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. You can try searching for the company name along with keywords like \"former employee\" or \"worked at\" to see if anyone has publicly shared information about their time with the company.\n3. **Industry Databases or Directories**: Depending on the industry the company operates in, there may be industry-specific databases or directories that list past employees or provide insights into the company's history. These could include trade publications, professional organizations, or industry forums.\n4. **Company Reviews and Feedback Sites**: Websites like Glassdoor or Indeed often have reviews and feedback from current and former employees. While these platforms may not provide a comprehensive list of ex-employees, reading through reviews and comments can sometimes give you insights into the company's culture and past employees' experiences.\n5. **Networking**: If you have contacts within the industry or know someone who used to work for the company, reaching out to them directly can be a valuable source of information. They may be able to provide insights into past employees or even connect you with individuals who have since moved on from the company.\n6. **Public Records**: In some cases, you may be able to find information about past employees through public records, such as press releases, regulatory filings, or news articles about the company.

        "post_body": "Hey guys and gals. I'm a former analyst at one of the big biotech-specialist hedge funds in Boston. I just left to manage my own investments, and I started a blog because why not? Believe it or not there can be deep value in biotech.  \nI think SPRB is a one of the most compelling risk/reward net-nets I've seen - market cap $28M (85% drop recently due to market overreaction to meaningless data \\[my opinion\\]); Ph2 readout in 3Q; validated MoA and good biomarker data; net cash after readout is \\~60M (I estimate). I've spoken to management and it's not obvious they'll burn all the cash if Ph2 fails. Pasting the text here but if you like it you should check out my blog for similar content, and subscribe.\n\n[https://open.substack.com/pub/vulpescapital/p/spruce-biosciences-upside-from-a?r=3pksaj&utm\\_campaign=post&utm\\_medium=web](https://open.substack.com/pub/vulpescapital/p/spruce-biosciences-upside-from-a?r=3pksaj&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)\n\nStandard disclosure stuff: I own a lot of this, not investment advice, do your own research, consult a financial advisor.\n\n**An overreaction to negative but largely irrelevant data has created an irrationally attractive opportunity for:**\n\n1. **High probability of success (PoS) Ph2 readout (validated mechanism \\[CRF1 inhibition in CAH\\], comparable biomarker data to nearly approved CRF1 inhibitor crinecerfont)**\n2. **Downside protection: Price to net-cash = 0.36. Price to net cash post-Ph2 readout = \\~0.5**\n\nSummary\n\nSPRB is developing tildacerfont, a second-generation CRF1 antagonist for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A discussion of CAH pathology and standard of care follow below. CRF1 is a validated mechanism (first-gen CRF1 antagonist, crinecerfont, will likely be approved in April).\n\nSPRB is a single-asset company, and has everything riding on tildacerfont. In mid-March, tildacerfont failed in a Ph2 CAH trial (study 203). Typically, when single-asset biotechs fail in Ph2, the company is dead. The market has decisively taken this position, and sent shares down \\~85% on the news, where they have stayed.\n\nSPRB is not dead. The company will release results from a second, more relevant, Ph2 (study 204) in 3Q24. I would argue that 203\u2019s failure has little impact on the future of the company and that the trial was designed such that it tells us nothing about the prospects of study 204, which are quite positive.\n\nStudy 204 is being run in a much more appropriate patient population, and has a good PoS (60%-70% in my opinion).\n\nAt present, the market is offering an irrational price at which one can make a bet on 204\u2019s outcome with a reasonable degree of downside protection (cash).\n\n* Market cap = $28M (not fully diluted \u2013 warrants priced way OTM)\u00a0\n* Net cash = $81M\n* Burn = \\~$12M per quarter\n* Quarters to data = 2\n* Projected net-cash post Ph2 readout = \\~$57M\n\nThough I\u2019m typically not inclined to assume downside protection from cash in dev-stage biotechs (and SPRB management is not very invested), the cash here is considerable, and management has few other options to squander the cash.\n\nThough I\u2019m not relying on a short-term price prediction, it wouldn\u2019t shock me if SPRB traded up into data as investors digest the fact the study 203 data weren\u2019t interpretable positively or negatively, and I would consider selling before 204-readout if offered a fair price.\n\nCAH\n\nPatients with classic CAH are unable to make cortisol due to a genetic deficiency in the enzyme (21-hydroxylase) responsible for its production. Cortisol is a negative regulator of a signaling pathway called the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA). Below, I do my best to explain the HPA\u2019s role in CAH, in plain English:\n\nAndrogens are hormones produced by the adrenal gland which have an effect on bone density, muscle mass, and reproductive development among other things. The best known example of an androgen is testosterone.\n\nAndrogens are produced in response to a signal from the pituitary gland to the adrenal gland. The signal molecule is called ACTH.\n\nACTH is produced in response to a signal from the hypothalamus to the pituitary. The signal molecule is called CRH. The pituitary receives the CRH signal through a receptor called CRF1.\n\nThe amount of CRH production by the hypothalamus (and thus ACTH and androgen production) is negatively impacted by the presence of cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal gland in response to ACTH. Thus, a hyper-active HPA will produce more cortisol, which puts on the HPA\u2019s brakes and keeps it in check. Conversely, an under-active HPA will produce little cortisol, which can boost it. Lots of signaling pathways maintain homeostasis in a similar way.\n\nBecause patients with CAH cannot make cortisol, they have over-active HPA\u2019s, and make way too many androgens. A whole lot of bad things happen when patients produce too many androgens\u2014examples include deformed genitalia, early puberty, shortened stature, and inability to regulate salt concentrations.\n\nAdditionally, cortisol absence results in other problems unrelated to androgen production.\n\nCAH treatment\n\nThe two main goals of treatment are 1) resupply the body with cortisol, because it needs it, and 2) resupply the body with cortisol to dampen the HPA and reduce excess androgen production.\n\nAs such, patients take a glucocorticoid (GC; a steroid; basically cortisol). Since they can\u2019t make cortisol, they\u2019ll have to take a GC for the rest of their lives.\n\nCAH patients need to take very high GC doses to dampen androgen production, which leads to significant side effects such as stunted growth, obesity, increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, skin toxicities, gastrointestinal disorders, and reduced lifespan. GC doses also need constant readjustment. Basically, they\u2019re not fun to take.\n\nCRF1 inhibition\n\nIf we refer back to the mechanism of CAH pathology, it would seem that if you could block the signal (CRH) from the hypothalamus to the pituitary, that might have the same effect of dampening the HPA as cortisol does. One could achieve this through the design of an antagonist (drug) that binds CRF1, blocking CRH\u2019s access to the receptor.\n\nDoes this work? Yes, we already know that it does. Crinecerfont (Neurocrine) is a first-generation CRF1 inhibitor that generated positive Ph3 data in CAH. Patients on crinecerfont were able to reduce GC usage to a stat-sig greater extent than patients on placebo. Moreover, 68% of patients on crinecerfont reduced GC usage to a physiologic level, compared to 18% on placebo. The drug will likely gain FDA approval in the coming weeks (PDUFA date April 30). Estimates of peak sales are in the $1B range).\n\nTildacerfont\n\nTildacerfont is a second-generation CRF1 antagonist. Compared to crinecerfont, tildacerfont has better pharmacokinetics and is being dosed once-daily vs. twice-daily.\n\nDoes tildacerfont work? It appears to\u2026 we have proof of mechanism/target engagement. Here\u2019s what we know:\n\nIn patients with poor disease control, tildacerfont (when they take it) significantly reduces elevated ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 levels (the latter two are downstream markers). Biomarker levels rose again upon termination of treatment (data not shown - can't copy image here).\n\nIn patients with good disease-control (patients without severely elevated androgens), tildacerfont didn\u2019t have much of an effect. That\u2019s not such a bad thing\u2014 the goal is not to lower androgens (which are already successfully controlled in this population), but to allow these patients to reduce their GC usage.\n\nThese biomarker responses were approximately similar to those observed after 2-weeks of treatment with crinecerfont (data not shown - can't copy image here).\n\n**All this to say, tildacerfont has a good shot at reading out positive data in study 204, which has the same primary endpoint as crinecerfont\u2019s phase 3, and a similar patient population.**\n\nWhy this opportunity exists: Phase 2 failure\n\nThere are two types of CAH patient:\n\n1. Patients with severe-CAH and poor-disease control. These patients struggle to control their HPA\u2019s despite GC usage. The goal in treating these patients is to bring their androgen levels back towards the upper limit of normal.\n2. Patients with good disease-control. These patients, through GC usage have androgen levels close to or within the normal range. The goal in treating these patients is to allow them to reduce their total GC usage.\n\nSpruce decided to run two Ph2 trials\u2013one in each patient group, with the goal of 1) improving disease-control in poorly controlled patients and 2) allowing patients with good control to lower their GC usage. The Ph2 in patients with severe-disease patients (study 203) read out last week. The Ph2 in patients with good disease control (study 204) will read out in 3Q24.\n\n203 did not meet its primary endpoint \u2013 a reduction in A4. This looks like a very bad sign and the market reacted mercilessly. There are 40M shares outstanding, and 37M shares traded in the three days following data read-out.\n\nWhy did this trial fail and what does this mean for the next one?\n\nThe company is blaming their Ph2 failure on poor patient compliance, and I find this to be a reasonable explanation\u2014only 50% of patients were >80% compliant.\n\nThe low compliance is cause for concern because a safety/tolerability issue could derail the drug. The company is making the argument that low compliance is an attribute of the poorly-controlled-CAH patient population. I don\u2019t like to blindly trust management teams when they make statements like this, but take comfort in their disclosure that compliance is much higher in study 204. Moreover, discontinuations were quite low at 10% (typically you\u2019d expect around 20%) and there were no safety issues.\n\nThe company found a KOL to attend their post-data investor call and say that \u201cThe CAHmelia-203 results underscore the complexities inherent in managing a patient group with challenges related to androgenic control and GC compliance. Based on my clinical experience, patients within this group may face difficulties adhering to any therapeutic interventions, potentially impacting treatment outcomes\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on the call as to the reason for the low compliance in the 203 population, she insinuated that these patients are often poorly-controlled as a result of their low adherence to medication. This sounds reasonable, but again, what\u2019s important is that we already know compliance is much higher in study 204.\n\nThe KOL added that the population in the ongoing Ph2 is more indicative of the patients that are seen in the clinic.\n\nIn sum, given the validated mechanism, observed biomarker data, and improved compliance, I give the ongoing Ph2 a 60%-70% PoS.\n\nValuation\n\nThe valuation range post-positive data is wide, but I\u2019m not concerned with precision since the value is most assuredly multiples of $29M.\n\nSell-side analysts are projecting $500M peak sales (could be higher, as they project crinecerfont peak sales of $1B). At 2X peak sales, accounting for exercise of options/warrants plus 30% dilution on top, I arrive at $13/sh on approval. Discounted back two years and adjusted for PoS, I arrive at $7.5/sh of fair value today. It sounds a little crazy to say that the FV today is 10X the current price given study 204 data is on its way in two quarters, but I would consider that a month-and-a-half ago the stock was trading in the $5 range and, in my opinion, the prospects of the drug haven\u2019t changed at all. Though I can\u2019t predict short-term price action, I would not be surprised to see this trade up into data and would consider getting out before 204 read-out if given a fair price.\u00a0\n\n*Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this blog post are solely those of the author and should not be construed as investment advice.

In addition to lack of competition from large funds, you need to have technical knowledge to participate meaningfully. Most people with that knowledge work outside of the investment industry, and those who do are usually at large funds that don't play in the small cap sandbox.\n\nI consider myself value-investor with a side passion for/PhD in biology. The technical knowledge just allows me to play in a more attractive sandbox.\n\nI usually look for drugs that look like they work and fill an unmet need, but at a significant bargain. There are lots of good drugs in development but if you pay a lot for them, it'll be hard to generate a good risk-adj return. Usually, this manifests in buying drugs that look good but a clinical trial design failure or something sent the stock way down.\n\nJust my opinion, but it seems like the real value inflections are post proof-of-concept trials (ph1b or ph2, typically). Sometimes, you have mechanistic valuation (the drug has the same mechanism as something else that's already done well in the clinic). This is the case with SPRB's drug. The bargain comes from them having failed that first ph2 trial that they arguable never needed to run in the first place.\n\nApologies but I don't have specific thoughts on any of those companies you mentioned.",

Starting to question if I should've posted these though...\n\nAn example of a company with a good margin of safety that didn't work out: \n\nDYAI is a company that, pre-covid, had a fungal strain that could produce really large quantities of enzymes. They sold this to dupont for something like $50-75M (the exact numbers escape me) or like $1.80 in cash. Price was $1.30 or so.\n\nThe CEO said they were going to take 2 years, burn $0.20 per share trying to develop this strain for biologic manufacturing (Dupont allowed them to do this, they were only interested in industrial enzymes). If it worked, it was gonna be worth a lot. If not, who cares, I make $0.50 with basically no risk. CEO owned 30% of the shares so I felt this was believable, as he wouldn't want to squander his net worth.\n\nAs it happened, pharma was/is apparently not interested for whatever reason. Then covid happened and the CEO got obsessed with making a vaccine. I sold out when it was clear he'd burn the company to the ground trying to \"make it\". Luckily, there was a covid bump in the stock and I made a little money, but I don't really count that as a \"success\".

Let\u2019s break down simply their HBO shows to put things in perspective.. \n\nTheir HBO shows alone are a fucking power house I\u2019m definitely watching shows including anything related to Game of Thrones, The Last of Us, White Lotus, True Detective, The Regime, Curb your enthusiasm, Tokyo Vice, The Righteous Gemstones, Peacemaker, etc. list goes on. \n\nAND this is assuming they don\u2019t produce new shows. They also have done incredible series as of lately including Succession, Barry, Westworld, Watchmen, etc.. Some of the best shows of all time they have under their belt including the Sopranos and the Wire.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about movies. They got DC comics. Cool. It isn\u2019t living up to hype as marvel did but there is still potential. But let\u2019s think about simply the cult following of Game of Thrones and VERY LIKELY now Dune. This alone sets them up for a ton of success in the coming 5-10 years. \n\nI\u2019m buying loads of WBD right now. Keep giving me your guys\u2019 cheap shares please.",

It's in the 3 main contenders for having a strong streaming future, with Disney and Netflix. It's also profitable from a OIBDA perspective and a cash flow perspective, as it's clearly writing off a ton of shows and content for tax purposes. This high amortization isn't a cash expense, so they have a solid amount of cash to work with. They've considerably paid off their debt, and they're in a position where they don't have much debt due over the next few months. This is actually the first time since the merger that WBD has had cash to work with.\n\nI do, however, have 2 major worries. The first is obviously cord cutting. The business still holds a heavy amount of exposure to cable television. Disney and Comcast have both made transitions away from needing cable television, as other areas of their businesses have taken lead(Disney with DTC, Comcast with Broadband internet and a bit DTC). Meanwhile, the 2 beat down streamers in Paramount and WBD are still heavily exposed to cable, as more than half their respective revenue comes from cable. That is really scary to buy into, and it wouldn't be as big of a deal if it wasn't for the second major worry: management. Media is, inherently, an industry that requires executives to constantly be paying attention to what consumers want and how consumer trends move. It seems like a lot of executives in media are SUPER out of touch with what people actually want. Iger is getting into his 70s, Brian Roberts is in his mid 60s. The Paramount CEO just got fired. Zaslav is somehow the youngest of the 4 major studios, at a mighty young age of...64. He doesn't really have any direction for the business, past paying off debts. I'm just not sure he's got a vision for the business and where it should be. I can excuse Iger not having a vision, because we're not even sure whether he'll be around soon, and he probably would've fully left the business by now if it wasn't for covid. I cannot excuse Zaslav having no real vision or leadership for WBD, and I'd hope for a younger, more decisive executive to come in and lead instead.",

The interiors of its restaurants are decked out in red and feature slogans such as \u201cmade in China\u201d and \u201cChinese stomachs love Chinese burgers.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nNot to be outdone, Chicago-based McDonald\u2019s has been offering new creations such as wraps made of chicken and pickled bamboo shoots, and promotions that have included Coca-Cola-flavored chicken wings and a sandwich made of Spam luncheon meat and Oreo cookie crumbs.\r  \n\r  \nThe company has created quirky promotions appealing to younger customers that have gone viral on social media. One is a combo meal that comes in a \u201ccat box\u201d made for felines to play in. In some stores the chain also unveiled exercise bikes equipped with trays, allowing riders to munch their meals while pedaling to wirelessly charge their mobile phones. \n\n. . . . . . . . . \n\nChina is now the fastest-growing market for McDonald\u2019s and its second-largest by number of stores, with more than 5,500, the company said in November. The more than 1,000 new restaurants McDonald\u2019s opened in China last year marked a record for the company, Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden said during a February earnings call. \r  \n\r  \nSome lunchtime diners on a recent afternoon at a McDonald\u2019s in Beijing said that while they are aware of the upstart Tastien, they like the U.S. burger chain\u2019s consistent offerings and find it a reliable location to see friends and hold business meetings. Tastien didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n. . . . . . . . .   \n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s dominates the burger landscape: Its market share among fast-food restaurants in China serving beef burgers rose to 74.6% last year from 71.5% in 2018, according to Euromonitor International.\r  \n\r  \nOne popular McDonald\u2019s meal in China allows customers to purchase two items, such as a double cheeseburger and a portion of chicken nuggets, for $1.92.\n\n. . . . . . . . .   \nMunching on a cumin-flavored duck burger at a rival Tastien restaurant in Beijing one recent afternoon, Zhan Yirou said he spent 20 yuan, equivalent to $2.76, including a discount offered to first-time visitors, for a combo meal that also came with chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken.   \n\u201cI had McDonald\u2019s burgers yesterday and wanted to try something new today,\u201d he said. While he enjoyed the taste, he said he didn\u2019t see a huge price difference, and probably won\u2019t return to Tastien.  \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t just consider visiting Tastien to support the so-called Chinese hamburger, as quality and taste matter more,\u201d he said.\n\n===========================================      ",

        "post_body": "Most of these are from Warren and Charlie obviously\n\n1. I won't buy a company if I don't like using their product. Disney is a good example of this for me.  I for a while now have thought a lot of their content is sh**, even when Iger was in charge.  Not saying it's not a good buy, but just not for me\n2. I won't buy a company if I don't like their ceo.  And in general I want to really think the ceo is smart, talented and capable. One of my favorite CEO's right now i Satya Nadella. Elon Musk is a great example of a CEO I don't like.  He's brilliant but an a** hole and way to mercurial for me.  Even if TSLA started trading at a great price, I'd pass.  Cyber Truck epitomizes my greatest concern with someone like Elon.  \n3. I won't buy \"Cigar butt\" plays or companies.  I feel like the downside is often underplayed (zero gains or a minor loss) and the best upside is often doubling your money and then selling.  Then you have to find another company and repeat.  Paramount is a company that comes to mind that I passed on for this reason.  I'd rather buy a company I can hold for the long run if it does well.  \n4. I won't buy the most current hype stock. Right now Nvidia.  2021 was Bored Apes lmao and before that TSLA.  It's not that these are always bad plays but I want to avoid FOMO causing a loss.  There are plenty of opportunities out there imo.  When Nvidia is everywhere the chance of it being a good price isn't great.\n5. Certain business I avoid with no exception.  Car companies, commercial airline, Pharma/bio tech, tobacco and clothing retail come to mind.  A good stock right now that represents this is CROX.  It might be a great buy.. or it's just a fad.  I'd rather buy something a bit more certain. I'm starting to think all brick and mortar type stores should go here (kohls is the new BBBY change my mind).  What others would you all add to this?\n6. I won't invest in Chinese companies.  I'd also add any country that is extremely corrupt, unstable, etc. \nAlibaba is peak for me on this one.  In general I think an Authoritarian rule is too much of a threat to make up for this risk honestly.  I passed on Alibaba this whole time and so far so good.  Will continue to pass on it and all Chinese companies.\n7. I won't invest in companies with questionable moats.  I think Paypal comes to mind right now.  Is it a good price? Yes.  Do the numbers look good.  Also yes.  Does the moat look good? No.  20 years ago sending money was hard.   Preventing and managing fraud especially was hard.  With the advent of the smart phones came reliable 2 factor authentication. That and ai (formerly known as machine learning lmao) has massively cut down fraud on these platforms (meaning it's an easier business to create and not lose a shit ton).  Additionally all active banks moved into the internet age making sending money a hell of a lot easier.  Google and Apple are positioned extremely well to compete and I believe it will definitely hurt Paypal over the next decade. Both also have a shit ton of cash which is nice when you are involved in the world of money and credit.\n8.   I won't buy a stock that I can't see myself still owning 10 years from now.To be clear, I not saying I will hold stuff for 10 years.  I'm just saying that's the long term timeline I want to be thinking on.  A great business should continue to do well for the next decade at least... If it's in situation where that's a concern, you might want to look at something else\n9. No companies that are heavy handed on the politics.  It's a distraction, it's exhausting and misses the point of a business.  This goes for left and right wing companies.\n10. \u201cBe Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful\u201d - Warren Buffet\n\n\nAlso, I'm not saying any of the stock above are bad.

If expect the unexpected, draw out a pay off diagram in a mathematical equation with a p-value of 1. Aka - you always earn even if you lose. \n3) fundamental analysis always wins\n4) focus on not being stupid, not focus on being clever \n5) never use stop loss, hedge funds, banks and market makers use LOB (limit order book) strategies to break through the stop-loss. A stop loss isn't for the trader, it's made for the others to benefit from\n6) if you're convinced, I'm not holding back, I'm going in 200% after I ensured I drew my pay off diagram and all downside is covered \n7) if I trade an event; I sometimes trade 30 or 40 trades. aX+B = Y. If Y is event, the left are just infinite ways to profit from it. So a \"war\" can mean an event where I throw in 14 stocks, 2 caplets, 4 options, 2 fra's, a few xccy swaps, a zcb bond, corporate government bonds, pick up debt issuance of cash rich firms. All because it leads to the same event. \n\nLike a \"formula one race\".\n\n- means hotels \n- means airlines \n- means commodities \n- means insurance firms\n- means xccy swaps\n- means airline manufacturers \n- etc.\n\nAll for just one trading event. \n\n8) I always apply a Bayesian inference methodology to my investment style. But so does Buffet, Burry, Icahn, Ackman, Dalio, etc.\n\n9) I realize I don't have to trade. I feel no urge. I pick my moments. \n\n10) I know the difference between linearity and non linearity.\n\n11) I abuse #wsb for straddles and strangles when I see idiots boosting a dead firm around earnings, check the option chain, and I don't have the intellect #wsb has (it goes up or down) so I just capture the \"volatility in pips\". Given they are OTM options, I offset the bleeding of margin with debt issuances of firms which have cash buffer > the outstanding short maturity debt issuance I grabbed. Just to grab free yield. \n\n12) and so forth. I traded since 99/00s. Never had a loss trading year\n\n13) I try to keep it simple. Some firms are dead and will die. Spotify/Lyft etc. Because if not dead, cheaper, and non correlated assets with higher cash buffers might pick em up. \n\n14) if at IPO the owners dump the stock, the stock will never do well. If at IPO owners keep; I might hold\n\n15) regulators don't understand finance; so they use fixed risk evaluation. I read a regulatory paper and see they want a month end figure. In other words, banks roll hedges between month end to next close of business. \n\n16) every time a micro stock grows in market cap, exchanges have fixed rules. If a micro stock grows it simply goes a higher stock exchange. You can forecast that. In other words, it will spike once it does because people will notice it more.\n\n17) remain humble. I never kid myself that I'm the best. Therefore I draw off a pay off diagram as I want to see my downside. I block that off mathematically. After that I pick up cash generating assets to stop margin bleeding and crank my leverage.\n\n18) feel free to reach out for free advice\n\n19) never watch YouTube videos, buy books on trading.

I'll admit, its not a buffet stock at all, but it does seem to have a good value provided the potential I see with what they're doing.\n\n04/29/2024  \nAMD: \\~250B market cap  \nNvidia > 2.2T market cap  \nIntel: \\~ 130B market cap  \nTSMC \\~620B market cap  \nSamsung \\~ 310B market cap  \nIf I'm going to buy one of these companies with the most upside over 5-10 years, I'm struggling to see how intel isnt a strong contender given the current price. If Pat executes on his plan and becomes number 2 behind TSMC thats at least 2x upside and probably more. Hard to see a world where if Intel returns to growth, its not at least valued similarly to AMD.\n\nIm encouraged by the major increase in R&D spending.  This is the pain of their missteps. Intel is partly in the situation its in because previous CEO's neglected EUV and other technological advances to preserve margins. Now, Intel will be the first to rollout High NA EUV. Theyre going to be the first to do backside power delivery. Theyre focusing heavily on being the innovator they once were before an MBA took over as CEO (as opposed to an engineer like Pat).\n\nI know there are many other metrics to look at other than market cap. Revenue has been declining, earnings have been declining, it seems as if everything will continue downward but I doubt this trend will continue much longer.  At the current price, it looks like there is at least a reasonable expectation of preserving your investment and a solid chance at large upside if Pat executes and I might add... theyve been executing so far on their plan. The sales/revenue/earnings just havent come yet. Maybe it never will, but I think its a good bet.\n\nAll this being said, I would love to see what others are thinking about and the metrics they care about when evaluating this sector. I think that the chip industry is going to be one of the most important of the next 50 years.  I'm still learning and will also be buying the fidelity select semiconductor mutual fund if there is ever a broad downturn. ",

                "comment_body": "There is an average of like, 3-4 posts a week about intel, so I'll just copy paste a previous answer \n\n  \nIntel is a play on the growth in demand for CPUs in the near future. Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",

I thought AMD and Intel always had been kinda a 50/50 player in both CPUs for laptop, desktop and datacenter. \n\nHuge mistake cause AMD used to have nothing and Intel used to own the market. AMD really got out of the bottle a couple years ago and Intel will never be able to crush them so badly again that AMD can't get into the market like they used to. \n\nSo going forward, they will have to share more of that market with AMD and have lower margins.\n\n2. x86 architecture. I thought this was also a part of their moat. Them and AMD are the only ones who can technically make these CPUs and therefore I thought they wouldn't have additional competition. Then Apple came with their M1 ARM based  chip and made MacOS be able to run on it. Not much later I see Windows slowly being able to run on ARM as well. \n\nSo now, suddenly you see more competition for the laptop, desktop and soon datacenter CPU space as well beside from just AMD. I wouldnt be surprised if Nvidia also goes after some market there. Qualcomm already trying to do it. \n\nSo Intel went from having basically zero competition in the CPU space to full on competition (which is still increasing). Nvidia being a 2 trillion dollar company now (compared to a maybe 10% of that when I invested in Intel) gives them access to raise capital extremely easy too...  \n\nI dont know how much cloud still needs x86 architecture, maybe still for a couple years, but im not betting on it.\n\n3. GPU wise Intel is years away from coming anywhere close to Nvidia and AMD. Especially in the datacenter GPU. Nvidia has been working on this for the last 10-15 years and AMD for quite a while as well while Intel just recently started a couple years ago. Will be years before they launch anything decent here.\n\nThen there is Mobileye. I just don't know about this one. I thought they were gonna spin off more shares at a 50bn valuation 2 years ago but they were too slow. Its hard to see whether Mobileye will be competitive enough or not with other big companies in the self driving industry..\n\nThe only good thing is are the investments in foundry. The US will invest a lot in it but TSMC and Samsung will also build foundries in the US. Nothing is certain here for Intel although I think some companies will like to use both TSMC and Intel to diversify supply chains.. \n\nI'm not touching the stock anymore for the foreseeable future.",

For the sake of brevity, I'm going to ignore CPU and GPU which I believe are key to Intel's potential success. Rather I'm going to write about the Fab which has been what kept me away from the company.\n\nThe main problem with the semiconductor industry is you're either ahead and everyone uses you or you're behind and you start to bleed customers. It's not like Coke and Pepsi where it's down to consumer preference there is typically an objectively better technology that can be mathematically quantified. \n\nFurthermore, new semiconductor foundries are extremely expensive and have very high fixed costs. If these foundries don't run with significant volumes then expect them to burn cash. \n\nTSMC has in recent times had the best process technology and companies like Apple, AMD, and Nvidia collaborate with TSMC to share R&D costs and in exchange for early access to TSMC's new process technology (Node). This is a big benefit for these companies because it leads to more efficient better performance products thus leading to higher sales and more collaboration with TSMC. Naturally, this is sort of a self-perpetuating cycle where TSMC benefits from other companies' R&D.\n\nFor these reasons, the semiconductor industry is sort of naturally monopolistic. \n\nTo overcome this Intel needs to build multiple billion-dollar fabs. Catch up with TSMC on process technology and build strong relationships/tools so other customers can manufacture at Intel Foundry services. Even if this is accomplished they need to stay in the lead against a TSMC which will no doubt see this as an existential threat to themselves and possibly even their country. All of this is extremely expensive and carries major risks to the company.\n\nFurthermore, what happens if there's a glut of supply from the semiconductor fabs? After all Global Foundries Samsung and TSMC are all building fabs. Do we really need all this increased capacity? If Intel builds these hugely expensive bleeding edge fabs and there's a recession or semiconductor glut then I'd imagine the fabs will quickly start burning cash. Even if Intel has the best process technology.\n\nIt would be one thing if Intel was still a CPU monopoly but those days gave sailed. It just appears to me that they're pursuing this strategy from a position of weakness and I fear it won't end well. \n\nThe irony is this strategy was tried before by AMD with global foundries and it almost bankrupted them. Intel's gambit seems similar and it has me worried that the result will be the same. That said it will be brilliant if they pull it off.",

But this market treats CPU like a commodity: it cares about price per compute and energy consumption.\n\nIt\u2019s like you said: there is competition everywhere, but the worse is that I think Intel have the inferior product in the declining markets.

All sectors except the very defensive will be hurting because production will be very low. \n\nGreat points about Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and TSMC as well. Historically and currently I would like to point out that Microsoft has had a strong relationship with Intel. It\u2019s rumored that Nvidia will also be a customer with Intel foundry but it isn\u2019t confirmed. Hopefully this point applies to both. \n\nIf we enter a \u201cCold War\u201d or maybe just a \u201ccool war\u201d with China. Arms races will be in technology and if China ever gets into a difficult economic spot, Taiwan will be on the table militarily. I struggle to see a world where a chip glut lasts for an extended period of time and in that scenario, all stocks will be hammered because that means production is going to be in the tank. That being said, if you\u2019re right, TSMC will be in a monopolistic situation. \n\nAs far as capacity goes, yes, I think we will. Turnover on old chips plus new products requiring better chips coupled with AI should drive significant demand except in the recession scenario where production grinds to a halt but again, if that happens, a lot more than intel is in trouble. \n\nThe bull case is that TSMC is failing to meet demand and Intel fills the void with equally competent or even better chips so it doesnt come down to preference as much as what you can get. Intel can also take market share by undercutting prices with their integrated fab/chip design capability while still maintaining strong margins. A big if, but I tend to be pro Pat and believe his strategy. \n\nThe super bull case is that Taiwan is militarily blockaded or invaded by China and Intel becomes the most important foundry in the west. \n\nI also think that intel is closer than people think to taking the technological lead from TSMC in manufacturing. They\u2019re first to High NA EUV. They\u2019re first to backside delivery. I think that the market is waiting to see if theyre not full of crap which they have been in the past. If Pat executes, theyre the most advanced foundry in the world by 2030. The money will come and I expect them to be at around 300-400B in market cap at that time which would provide me a sufficient return for the risk that I am taking on.",

A recession and too much capacity can cause a glut.\n\n>Intel wont be the only stock in trouble but it would certainly be extra troubled. All sectors except the very defensive will be hurting because production will be very low. \n\nSure but the fixed costs of Intel having under utilized fabs could bankrupt them. This is exactly what happened with AMD and Global Foundries although in fairness they also had an inferior product.\n\n>Great points about Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and TSMC as well. Historically and currently I would like to point out that Microsoft has had a strong relationship with Intel. It\u2019s rumored that Nvidia will also be a customer with Intel foundry but it isn\u2019t confirmed. Hopefully this point applies to both. \n\nDefinitely promising and Nvidia has been known for experimenting with new foundries. But I think this is still a lot more challenging than meets the eye. Problem number one is Intel needs to build out mature design tools for customers to build on their process. When GF was established they found this task to be so difficult that they went out and bought chartered semiconductors just for their design tools. The second issue is it's extremely expensive to onboard another semiconductor fab for example if you have a team designing for TSMC they are prevented from also working on Intel's node due to NDA's. This adds another layer of complexity.\n\n>The bull case is that TSMC is failing to meet demand and Intel fills the void with equally competent or even better chips so it doesnt come down to preference as much as what you can get. Intel can also take market share by undercutting prices with their integrated fab/chip design capability while still maintaining strong margins. A big if, but I tend to be pro Pat and believe his strategy. \n\n>The super bull case is that Taiwan is militarily blockaded or invaded by China and Intel becomes the most important foundry in the west. \n\nI'm still sort of skeptical. This isn't to say you're wrong but the semiconductor industry is historically a cyclical buisness. There's a lot of excitement around AI and GPU's but I'm not certain that the demand justifies all the new foundries from Samsung, TSMC, Intel etc. (Not to mention all the T2 fabs and memory companies). Furthermore each new node is giving us diminishing returns it seems to me that the fab buisness is slowly starting to become a commodity. Will Intel really be able to command high margins I'm such an enviorment?\n\n>I also think that intel is closer than people think to taking the technological lead from TSMC in manufacturing. They\u2019re first to High NA EUV. They\u2019re first to backside delivery. I think that the market is waiting to see if theyre not full of crap which they have been in the past. If Pat executes, theyre the most advanced foundry in the world by 2030.\n\nIn fairness, if they pull it off it will be an amazing investment. I just look at it and see alot of potential risk.",

Everyone will choose the M1 because it uses much less energy and it's way faster.\n\nSmartphones are dominated by ARM.\n\nAll cloud providers now have ARM chips that cost less per compute. That's because they are cheaper and more efficient.\n\nIoT uses non-x86 for much I know.\n\nWhat's left? Non-Mac desktops. We see Windows supporting ARM more and more. It's a slow migration process, but if we see the same level of increased compute and efficiency (which we are already seeing), it's a matter of time until the ARM ecosystem is good enough. Desktop games are still dominated by x86. That may continue, or it may not. With such a powerful Mac, Apple is increasing spending to have game developers build for their machines. Even if that doesn't pan out, the market has shrunk by so much (remember desktops are in secular decline) that I am not sure if there's money to be made with this reduced market.\n\n  \nWe have to acknowledge that all of this hardware runs on software that have layers of abstraction. Most programming languages (and the programs that are built with) can easily support different architectures. You can also use binary translators to ease the migration process and support legacy apps. If one architecture is superior to the other, it might take time, but eventually, the less superior architecture will die out.",

People have been too gung-ho on offshoring for the sake of profit for too long, and it's true that the pandemic revealed the dangers inherent in that path which were willfully ignored. Now we're playing catch up, and I wish success for all. But I'm cautious and skeptical.\n\nAnd that's because the landscape is fundamentally different now. New nodes are \\*very\\* costly, bot upfront and ongoing, and perf results don't scale nearly as well. For I/O and memory, there is practically no scaling benefit at all. So the days of \"build it and they will come\" are over until there is a more fundamental shift in chemistry. It's easy to imagine a scenario where one could be totally successful in creating a cutting edge node fab and still fail to be competitive wrt volume and margin. Those are critical for when the funding injection runs out. Potential designer partners shying away due to IP concerns is a large factor than the current plans have not addressed well enough IMO. Long term sustainability after the funding runs out is being too-glossed over. I see a lot of hand-waving where I would prefer to see strategic maneuvering.\n\nAs far as political risk goes, I disagree. Politics will serve tribe and/or profits before anything else, including a stable and secure economic supply chain. I don't see any real risk of consequences to anyone in power if subsidization of onshore production fails. It was just taxpayer money, after all. Most taxpayers are oblivious and the rest will take losses on the chin like always. Any failure can be easily blamed on other irrelevant factors/marginalized groups or otherwise distracted away.

The difference between RISC and CISC is very insignificant compared to other design choices.\n\nAlso use cases matter: A PC built on TileGX or on a GPU like architecture would be abysmal for most day to day workloads.  But doing Machine Learning or pushing pixels on a CPU would be much slower than on a GPU like architecture.\n\nTangent about the i686 core and example design choices and their consequences:\n\nThe Pentium 4 implemented some novel features such as domino circuits which are very very fast, but always require a full VCC (Voltage In).  This allowed for very high clock speeds on larger nodes such as 130nm, but for those to work, each micro-op code had to be very tiny, which led to eventually a 34 stage pipeline which did not lend it self to most compiled code--any branch (if statement) would cause the pipeline to flush loosing all previous progress.  So in theory, the Pentium 4 should have been very performant, but only if your application never had an if statement--unrealistic.  So they min-maxed for clock speed, at the expense of wattage, while most code just couldn't take advantage of that CPU design.\n\nEventually Intel's Israeli team on a VERY small budget took the old i686 (P6) core from the Pentium 3 (Which was a revision of the Pentium Pro), and threw on a modern cache, and the performance was roughly equivalent to that of a Pentium 4 for most workloads at much lower clock speeds and wattage.  This was the first Pentium M (Unrelated to the Pentium 4M).  This became the Core Duo, and eventually was refactored to become the replacement of the Pentium 4/D: the Core 2 Duo.\n\nThat's crazy, a 10 year old CPU design with some modern love--and few million dollars--outperforming billions of dollars of R&D and taking the crown back from AMD's Athlon 64.  (let's not even get into the anti-competitive practices of Intel during AMDs performance crown days of the 2000s)",

As for the pollution issues with the battery technology, i think it's pretty much a fad.\n\nAs for Artificial Intelligence it's a long non-stop road, of gradual steps and a lot of research and a lot of failures. I don't think the stuff like ChatGPT with having unreliable info, is just garbage in, garbage out. Having very robust and completely reliable systems is where computers can help in little tasks, but the hype i think is just ridiculous. As a stock thing, only the very big corporations are going to win out, and any 'results'  will take a decade to bear fruit.

Say I am looking to buy something like Wal-Mart right now because for whatever reason I think they are going to have a good 2024 holiday season.  If you wait until Q4 earnings come out and they are gangbusters there is going to be no profit to be made for you.  Even if you wait until the season is in full swing, its likely that funds that track traffic and do polls to gauge consumer habits and such will begin coming to the same conclusions and drive the price up well before they report holiday earnings.

An investment bank/internal corp dev team is gonna contact institutional investors and offer to buy shares back at a slight premium. \n\nCompanies definitely do buy back shares on the open market, but these are bought through various firms and institutions and spread out over years. After all, if google just dumped 80 billion into share buybacks in a day, you'd have major liquidity issues in the market. If you want your shares to be bought by Google, just continually sell and buy over a long time, and, eventually, one of those shares will be bought by Google.\n\nYou shouldn't buy a company because of share repurchases. Companies generate FCF and choose to spend it on a few things. They can buy other companies, service debt, reinvest it, distribute it as a dividend, buyback shares, or just sit on it(maybe I missed a few). Buying a company shouldn't be based on how they distribute their cash, but rather how much cash they make. After all, if you could buy a 100 dollar business that generates 20 dollars for it's owners, but chooses to reinvest that cash, that's probably better than a 100 dollar business that generates 10 dollars, and openly distributes it.",

Very difficult to long-term time a 3x leverage, as it can blow up your portfolio by time. Also, average yearly return works very differently for leveraged etfs as the initial purchase price weighs heavy on your returns. Maybe if you had bought it at the beginning of last year, you would have decent short-term returns. Also, TQQQ should never be held long-term because of decay principles , it hurts me to see people attempt to hold a leveraged etf like TQQQ only to end up blowing one's portfolio entirely. \n\nSecondly, Im not sure if you know what value investing is. Value investing usually pertains to examining a single stock that seems undervalued using valuation methods such as a DCF or relative multiples or looking at some hidden catalysts. VOO is usually overweighted because of technology companies having high premium valuations (also their weighting in comparison to other sectors) because of their growth expectation, making QQQ even more overvalued because QQQ is more tech-centered. Then there is TQQQ, which is 3x QQQ meaning its 3x'ing the already heavily high valuations. \n\nIf you want a long-term ETF portfolio with long-term horizons and risk taking stomach, then go around a 60% VOO 10% Us bonds 30% QQQ. \n\nAlso ask those questions on /r investing not here",

Additionally, I am contemplating whether to adopt a step-ladder pattern by purchasing bonds with varying maturities, such as 2 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 10 years, or simply focus on 10-year bonds. I would greatly appreciate your insights, as I am in my 40s and seeking to make informed investment decisions.\n\nThank you.",

        "post_body": "Cooper-Standard, a leader and global suppliers of sealing systems and component, fuel and brake delivery, and fluid transfer systems was a pre-pandemic money tree cranking out over $8 EPS. During the pandemic, when global light vehicle production was cast into the depths of hell, multiple competitors within the space were forced to close shop; although $CPS remained afloat it did not come out unscathed. Instead, the stock plummeted into freefall, and was down over 90% from it's all-time high. But like my grandma says, when there is blood in the streets, buy real estate. And gentlemen, I have opened $CPS as my largest position and it's my 2024 best-performer pick. Let me explain why.\n\nDuring the pandemic, global light vehicle production volumes fell to a low of 77.6 million units in 2020. Mr. Fu Bingfeng, President of OICA, described the sharp downtrend as \"the worst crisis ever to impact the automotive industry.\" Due to being inherently dependent on light vehicle production, Cooper Standard's top line was obliterated. They went from an untouchable EPS and EBITDA monster to complete stagnation.\n\nWith production annihilated, it is no surprise that eight auto parts suppliers filed for bankruptcy between 2020 and 2021. While Cooper-Standard survived the chaos, revenues declined by over 35%, and shareholders experienced a 90% drop in share price. During the post-pandemic recovery, another major headwind emerged. The UAW strike once again halted light vehicle production for three of Cooper Standard's largest customers. Today, these obstacles have been successfully navigated, and the ascent to reclaim the throne has never been more clear.\n\nLight vehicle production is now on a tear for a multitude of reasons. First, the average age of a vehicle on the road is currently sitting at an all time high of 13.6 years. That coupled with the fact that current domestic auto-inventory sits at 1.4 months (meaning the current stock of automobiles could only supply 1.4 months of sales) creates a huge impetus to start cranking out vehicles. And vehicle production = $CPS profits. Better yet, the vehicle production numbers from Q1 2024 are significantly exceeding consensus predictions. In every month in 2024 to date, vehicle sales have been significantly higher than in 2023. In March alone, vehicle sales were more than 100,000 units greater in 2024 than in 2023.\n\nThis boom in vehicle production and sales has lifted all major automakers than have already reported 1Q earnings, as they continue to beat and raise guidance.\n\nAs far as the financials are concerned, $CPS revenue and adjusted EBITDA show a clear inflection point in 2021, and with leaner costs from restructuring, coupled with the vehicle production turnaround, $CPS is poised to head to the moon gentlemen. Despite the clear path forward, the stock continues to trade \\~85% lower than its ATH. A major reason for this was the conservative guidance set forth by management at the Q4 earnings call, but during the call, the CEO of the company himself said, \"*Clearly, our light vehicle production units and the guidance that we've used for '24, you can see there are -- continue to be a bit conservative, I guess, is how I would describe it.*\" Well, the numbers coming in so far for 24 are far from the conservative estimates put forth by management, and I expect a resounding beat will be the result at their Q1 call in two weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: As mentioned above, I have opened a position in $CPS and as always do your own DD.",

Since 2019, management had made cuts that have contributed $479 million to adjusted EBITDA. They have improved operating efficiencies with smaller fixed cost structure, have higher margins on EVs due to them requiring 20% more content per vehicle, and renegotiated contracts with customers.  In short, they\u2019re making more money on each car manufactured, we were just waiting for production to ramp up (which the Q1 vehicle sale numbers so far suggest has already started to happen.).  These sales numbers are approximating 2018 levels DESPITE interest rates remaining high, imagine what car sale volume will look like once rates are.\n\nThe debt is primarily long-term debt, which allows Cooper Standard to ride the tailwinds current in place within the automotive industry and pay back that debt as the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",

Tech change can see a shift in cost or benefit and first mover / scale advantage can be gone quickly, especially if the scale is based upon short lived investments that face a short obsolescence cycle and need replacement - like IT hardware.\n\nAt one time people thought there was no alternative to IBM.  Operational cost from scale is not a long term moat.  First mover is an advantage only if it blocks competitors out - which in history has been a geographic or network effect story.\n\nPeople don\u2019t switch from Apple ecosystem because of what they would lose.  Facebook has a similar network effect advantage.  Msft has high barriers to change because all the devs would need retraining to move away from Msft enterprise.  Google is at risk but there is an intersection of tools and monopoly that make it the gorilla you HAVE to work with.  All of these tech companies are actively working to leverage their strengths to defend their moats and make them stronger and integrate with AI.\n\nIs there anything similar wrt AWS?  Network effects?  Lots of investment on their customers side that would have to be redone?  An obvious pathway to staying ahead of the surprise innovation out of left field that takes out the scale advantage?\n\nI get the arguments on the shopping portal side, but that business has not been terribly profitable in history.  I don\u2019t see where the durable moat is wrt an industry (cloud compute) that is racing towards commodification with competition that can afford to sell cloud at a loss because of the benefit they get from integration with all of their other datasets and services.\n\nAny high margin business attracts competition.  Everyone races to innovate and in the process prices tend to crater.  Eventually it becomes a commodity market.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to prove you wrong, I\u2019m genuinely trying to understand this idea that Amazon has a durable moat.  Is it some sort of proprietary container code that can\u2019t be replicated?  Is there some specialized knowledge and an army of workers that would need retraining?  Is there a patent that gives Amazon a durable cost advantage?  Why would companies (cloud customers) be willing give their supplier strategic pricing power over their bottom line?  What is stopping a lower cost producer from taking share with better operational tech?\n\nI\u2019ve heard this idea that all the aws container code would have to be rewritten.  Why couldn\u2019t an LLM do that?\n\nWhat is preventing competition from taking business from Amazon?  What will prevent commodification?",

Amazon is a very misunderstood company and people underestimate the near-impossibility of penetrating their moat. \"If you can't see it, don't buy it\" is something I always use when discussing Amazon and Google. \n\nI'm 100% convinced they have broken economics/capitalism. Not in the sense that they're gonna collapse the system, no, in the sense that they have achieved such an immense size and expertise their moat in some core activities is literally impenetrable. That's cloud servers and same day delivery network for Amazon and Search/Android/YouTube for Google. \n\nThere is just no viable way for any possible competitor to challenge them because interest rates will never be 0% again. Amazon built a fully in-house logistical powerhouse only rivalled by the US military with free money for years while they hemmoraged cash. Now they are optimising for profit and you can see FCF just blowing though the roof.

Which we all already know how hard just that can make a stock tumble. Two, it used to operates solely in the online consumer finance market place.

Repushases would be a extremely effective tool .\n\nThe big risk:\nThe only real risk here is China. They're unpredictable, and have been a huge roadblock Chinese companies for years now.\n\nLooks into it yourself! Any other options would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n",

                "comment_body": "Just to add to what others have said:\n\n1) it\u2019s so that you can evaluate the business on its own merits.  Financial engineering is a real thing, compare a property rental company where they can buy assets with either 100% cash or 10% cash and 90% debt - the debt holders only receive a fixed income while any profits above this go directly to the shareholders after taxes, which means the return on investment can be hugely affected by the debt levels.  Therefore the merits of the business itself can be distorted by debt.\n\n2) It gives a clearer picture on how much debt a company can repay.\n\n3) Debt can distort the apparent value of a company, especially when using an earnings multiple as a valuation technique (e.g. a PE ratio). There are a few different ways that this could cause an error in judgement here: a) say EBIT is $100 and interest $90 leaving a profit of $8 after tax (at 20%), if companies in this industry are usually valued at a PE of 15, then you might think that the company should be worth $120 ($8 x 15).  But what if the company only has a year or two left on its loans?   Then the value would be radically different.  b) Another scenario, using the same figures above, is what if the company is growing very rapidly?  Using the same multiple to value both the business and the debt would clearly be an error in valuation. i.e. if earnings before tax in the following year is $200, the year after that $400, and the year after that $800, and if the debt and interest rates have remained unchanged at  just $90 interest per year, then applying an earnings multiple to the after interest figure would probably under value the company.\n\n4) A company is made up of the business itself (the assets, working capital, staff etc) and how it is financed (capital structure).  Debt is very easy to place a value on and usually the balance sheet figure is sufficient, though there can be exceptions that I won\u2019t get into.  So why complicate your evaluation of a business when you can simply deduct the debt at the end of your evaluation?  Having debt in the evaluation complicates things unnecessarily.  Again, there are exceptions, especially if the company has either significant debt - where a closer examination of the cash flows would be required, or very little debt - could be ignored for simplicity purposes.",

Look at a company like Transdigm. They have routinely recapitalized, particularly taking on debt to fund acquisitions, and like to run ~5x leverage. It has worked for them for decades, and they are not the only company to employ a similar strategy. When it comes to capital allocation, the answer is always 'it depends'.",

While I won't go over them in detail, these mistakes range from:\n\n* Making NextTrade too slow \n* Not making it configurable enough \n* Making it far too niche\n\nSince then, I've been developing a new platform called [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/). Unlike NextTrade, NexusTrade is freemium. I've done a lot of work making it suitable for all types of traders and investors. Some specfic features that would interest this group include\n\n* [Algorithmic trading using fundamental data](https://medium.com/p/95b0267a0dba)\n* [AI-Powered Stock Screener](https://nexustrade.io/blog/new-feature-launch--an-ai-feature-that-no-other-investing-platform-has-20240213)\n* [More traditional, UI-Based Simple stock screener](https://nexustrade.io/blog/i-just-created-the-worlds-best-stock-screener-20240404)\n\nThese features make it really easy to find value stocks and apply them to your algorithmic trading strategies.\n\n[I wanted to share my thoughts on making NexusTrade a freemium app.](https://medium.com/p/120ce4c90e3c) I think that by it being free-to-try, it can encourage the skeptics to actually try it out and see their results. However, it's also not cheap to host this platform, and I need to strike a balance between usefulness and cost-effectiveness.\n\n[My full thoughts are here.](https://medium.com/p/120ce4c90e3c) I'm really curious to get some feedback on how algorithmic trading can be applied to value investing, and what particular features are you looking out for in such a platform.",

Of course he's using reddit to bring a bit of visibilty to his project, who can blame him ? What are the alternatives ?

With BHP's recent bid being rejected and the pe firm Elliot Management announcing a billion-dollar stake in the company, it seems likely that the stock is set to run with a future offer having to be significantly more than the initial bid. However, there are still some uncertainties, particularly regarding the potential need for Anglo American to spin off significant portions of the company. Even at $16.40, the shares still appear undervalued to me given an imminent sale.

It is still almost 45% off its all-time high of $50.\n\nGiven the market dynamics, we believe that a convincing break of $30 for Silver could see it scale to greater heights with $50 in sight.\n\nThere have been consistent supply deficits, and this is not yet factoring in the potential investment demand from exchange-traded products.\n\nWith Treasuries still holding well but the US debt level scaling like there is no limit, we could potentially see a devaluation of the US Dollar should demand for Treasuries dissipate. \n\nThis would favour safe-haven and inflation-fighting instruments such as gold, silver and commodities.\n\nAlso, Gold has been setting new record highs, silver is still lagging. With this tailwind, it could see a price surge as silver has both industrial and investment merits.\n\nClick Here for the Full Article:\n\n[https://thebigfatwhale.com/is-silver-going-to-be-a-great-investment-50-target/]",

Just to put it in context, china believed it was silver while British believed it was gold. Can you guess who lost, got poor, and lost power? My point being if you\u2019re trying to protect yourself from inflation it\u2019s clear to pick the commodity that didn\u2019t get demonetization during the 19th and pick the winner.

As about additional information you could check 10k reports of similar companies to understand better.\n\nFor example Lennar and DR Horton published their time to build house and those numbers somewhat improved. You could compare those and find out how their administrative expenses per house changed because of that. Those two largest in industry but the whole industry operate in quite similar way. Note sales are far from being perfect but builders not going anywhere close to negative income numbers because of improvements in efficiency and some materials prices reduction.\n\nNow with understanding builders you can expect lumber or other building materials demand. If you following smaller companies they maybe focused on some region and so one.\n\nThis is just one industry and it quite simple to understand. However just getting through all builders it would take quite a time. As soon as low cap companies are not that interesting for funds, they are usually neglected in comments. For example MHO seems more dynamic than DHI and LEN, but I not found anything valuable online in addition to their 10k and earning calls.\n\nTo summarize, I do not believe individual investor would have reasonably enough time to research low and mid cap stocks 10k and earning call reports. As soon as this is the most important thing to do, there is no reason to look anything on top of that, before it is done. I not sure you would read till end though, as I not get answer on how much time it would take to read one 10k report for you.",

Take Ternium as an example\n\n\n\nTernium and its subsidiaries manufacture, process, and sell various steel products mainly in South America. This is cyclical company that is fundamentally sound. It doubled its revenue over the past 12 years through organic growth and acquisitions. It achieved a growing ROE with corresponding improvements in operating efficiencies. \n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/xCfGy3j6/Ternium.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xCfGy3j6/Ternium.png)\n\nWhen I last valued it a couple of weeks ago, there was a margin of safety.

I have nothing against replicating Buffett moves, but there is a huge risk of getting burned if we don\u2019t understand what the heck the move is and replicate only a part of it. With something like AAPL, it\u2019s simple. This, not so much. Remember, we can\u2019t see everything. We can mostly only see long positions. \n\nI initially thought this was an arbitrage play. Like ATVI. That makes sense if the price of SIRI doesn\u2019t keep deteriorating to below any advantage the arbitrage would have offered. If this was a pure arbitrage play, it already didn\u2019t work. \n\nIf this is a bet on SIRI, which it seems to be since they are also long SIRI itself, I can see the advantage in snapping up cheaper shares in LSMXA/K. But then again, they seemed to have timed it poorly so far and any advantage those shares offered was nullified. They would have done better to wait until after the merger to buy shares from all the people selling because they are not interested in the new share structure. \n\nBut then, they insist on these purchases despite all the above. Is it because BRK is too big to buy a large part of the float over a short period of time and is using this tactic to disperse its purchase? In that case, we would benefit from playing this like a Greenblatt merger play. Or is there more to this than meets the eye?\n\nThere is no doubt SIRI is great value here IF it can return to consistent revenue growth.",

I've only gone back to the end of 2017 and Sirius XM has been consistently profitable every quarter, except for the 4th quarter of 2020 when they booked a $976 million dollar impairment charge for the acquisition of Pandora.\n\nAs I wondered why the internet music streamers haven't been able to start strangling them, I think that it's because Sirius XM is primarily a broadcaster (it pays a fraction for licensing music compared to Spotify) and it makes the FCC license to broadcast part of their moat.  The business also seems to exhibit a healthy stream of free cash flow to support the dividend and share repurchases.\n\nTed Weschler, on the other hand, has been studying satellite radio since at least 2006.  His hedge fund reported holding shares of XM Satellite Radio beginning in the 3rd quarter of 2006.  Ted also had shares of DirecTV and EchoStar Communications starting years earlier.

In return, they move their operations to a new entity where Aker keeps 20% ownership and SLB 80%. SLB also adds their carbon business to the JV for 0.5B NOK which is around the remaining cash Aker has now.\n\nHave been trying to wrap my head around what this means for investors in Aker. Do they hold a share of this cash in exchange for a 5x dilution in the new joint venture company? Or is it something else? \n\nAppreciate any answers from anyone who had something similar.

A lot hinges on process leadership/competitiveness and executing at scale. That determination is a few more years down the road. \n\nI think there is good reason to be optimistic, but it is too early to tell if Intel will succeed. Still, if it drops to $25 I'd pick up more shares as I did last time",

                "comment_body": "Intel is a play on the growth in demand for CPUs in the near future. Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention. They're still fairly dominant in CPU sales, and are making impressive advancements in graphics and edge computing.",

        "post_body": "Alphabet and Microsoft are sending a clear message to investors: AI and Cloud Computing are two industries that are paying off.\r  \n\r  \nBoth companies released their earnings, and let us tell you, they did GREAT. Alphabet surged as much as 12%, pushing their [valuation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-parent-alphabet-reclaims-spot-2-trillion-valuation-club-2024-04-26/)past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose by as much as 3.5%, which is an impressive gain for them. \r  \n\r  \n**The Main Details:**\r  \n**Alphabet:**\r\n\n* New cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, the first in the company's history. \r\n* The board of directors also approved stock buybacks of around $70 billion. \r\n* Total revenue rose 16% from the same period last year.\r\n* Earnings per share beat estimates: $1.89 vs $1.53 expected.\r\n* Cloud revenue rose 30%, and Ad revenue rose 13%.\n\n**Microsoft:**\r\n\n* Total revenue rose 17%, and Profits rose 20%.\r\n* Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected.\r\n* Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud Segment rose 21%.\r\n* Azure and other cloud services rose 31%.\r\n* LinkedIn revenue rose 12%, Xbox revenue rose 62%, and PC revenue rose 18%.\n\nBoth tech titans are locked in a battle over the dominance of the AI field, but it seems as yesterday's results show that the market thinks these two companies have room to grow together.\r\n\n**Generative AI**\r  \n2024 is the year of generative AI, and it looks as though technology that can create text, images, and videos with prompts is here to stay. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAi to challenge Google\u2019s two-decade dominance of the internet, but Alphabet's own generative AI, Gemini, isn\u2019t too far back. \r\n\nThe space is becoming competitive, with both Alphabet and Microsoft executives saying their generative AI programs are driving more business for their cloud computing services. Corporate customers are also more open to making long-term investments in cloud infrastructure, increasing their trust in both companies.\r\n\nGenerative AI is giving a reason for corporations to come back and continue to use the cloud services of their company of choice. This gives the volatile tech industry some stability, with new demand and revenue coming in for both companies. \r\n\n**Google\u2019s Trailing Cloud Services** \n\nThis new intake in demand for cloud computing is a welcome turn for Google, which has long lagged behind industry veterans Amazon and Microsoft. After breaking even for the first time last year, the unit is now viewed as one of Google\u2019s fastest-growing businesses and best bet for growth as its core search advertising unit matures. Google\u2019s cloud operations pulled off a first-quarter profit of $900 million, well above analyst predictions of $672.4 million. \r\n\n**Gemini Comeback**\r\n\nGoogle\u2019s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks it had in the generative AI consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model, formally known as Bard but now rebranded to Gemini, was criticized for answering prompts with historically inaccurate images, promoting the company to stop generating pictures and depictions of people with its software.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since that obstacle, Google has been able to turn things around with Gemini. The enterprise product has told a very different story as the professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help ensure that the content released by the model stays consistent with their brand messaging to avoid mistakes like in Q1. Enterprise Gemini can be used to produce ads, videos, and podcasts.\r  \n\r  \n**Microsoft's Domination**\r\n\nThe narrative has been completely different for Google, with domination from the get-go. Generative AI has been an avenue for enterprise clients to spend more with Microsoft. The tech company has been infusing AI into the entire core product line with its technology partner OpenAI. \r  \n\r  \nThe bet is starting to pay off as customers are adding Microsoft\u2019s AI tools to help summarize documents and generate content. Alongside the addition of Copilat, Microsoft reported a 31% climb in revenue for its Azure cloud computing program, beating analysts expectations. 7% of this increase was attributed to AI which is a big deal. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub coding platform is also gaining more traction, recording 1.8 million new customers during this period an increase from 1.3 million of last quarter. This is largely due to their AI-coding assistant powered by OpenAI\u2019s largue language model, helping programmers streamline their code, answer any questions, and even convert code from one programming language to another. \r  \n\r  \nThe company is also seeing a large intake in their AI assistance tool meant to work synonymously with their Office suite software. The new tool costs companies an extra $30 a month on top of their existing subscriptions. Corporate customers are many in number including Goldman Sachs, Ford Motors, and Ernst & Young. Microsoft estimates that roughly 60% of the Fortune 500 uses Copilat.\n\n*Btw I wanna give credit where it's due:* [*This analysis was from here*](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe) ",

Once they add that im curious how many of those 200m users will do that in Chatgpt going forward instead of Googling it.\n\nI'm not saying these companies will all take over Google completely, but what is the chance Google keeps their 90% market share? Close to zero imo. Whether it drops to 20% or 70% is what I dont know. \n\nI dont believe what no one is going to use Meta Search instead of Google going forward.

I think Fairfax Financial FFH.TO or FRFHF makes great sense for up to 50% of the portfolio. It\u2019s very diversified and has a good shot at 5x in 10 years. Normally, that kind of concentration doesn\u2019t make sense but your portfolio is growing fast given your savings rate. E-L Financial ELF.TO or ELFIF, for 45% makes sense. It\u2019s like buying the market at a 50% discount so it\u2019s market return + how much the discount closes. The key is the high margin of safety. If you like gold, the final 5% in Mako Mining MKO.V or MAKOF makes sense. It\u2019s trading at a 20% FCF yield before growth and they have high return plans for the cash. In a gold bull, it could 10x in 10 years. It\u2019s controlled by Wexford Capital so it has grown up supervision unlike most gold companies and there is way more leverage with operators vs the metal itself. That\u2019s what I would do and obviously not financial advice!",

Also if at any point repayments are late, then impairments are recognised. E.g. under IFRS 9 rules it can be in 3 risk weighting stages, stage 1 is fine, stage 2 you need to recognise a %  as impairments but can still recognise interest payments, stage 3 large % is impaired and interest it put into ECL (expected credit losses). So basically if the borrower is prime and repays fully its quite simple, but subprime gets complicated as you recognise losses upfront, but they will be later adjusted depending upon what actually happens. IMO its why credit as a % of GDP is far less to sub prime since 08 as banks simply aren't as profitable. Whereas mortgages still very safe and lucrative, but competitive.",

        "post_date": "2024-04-26T08:29:25",
        "post_body": "\r  \n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR) \r  \n\r  \nStory by Andrew Bary\r  \n\r  \nWarren Buffett will be at center stage, as usual, during Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting. But investors are increasingly looking for clues on what the company will be like when the longstanding CEO and chairman is no longer running it.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire could come under pressure to break itself up when the world\u2019s most acclaimed investor exits the stage. It might decide to pay a dividend rather than amass cash, as it does today while Buffett, 93, waits for investing opportunities. Buffett can expect to face questions on all these topics and more at the annual meeting on May 4 in Omaha, Neb.\r  \n\r  \nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett\u2019s longtime friend, business partner, and Berkshire vice chairman, who died last year at 99, won\u2019t be at his side. Munger\u2019s absence will only reinforce the obvious: Buffett\u2019s time atop the conglomerate he built over six decades could end during the next few years. Even Buffett acknowledges as much, writing in November that he felt \u201cgood\u201d but was \u201cplaying in extra innings.\u201d\r  \n\n\nFor some 30,000 Berkshire shareholders expected to attend the meeting, the future will be the focus as Buffett fields questions for more than five hours in what could be his only public appearance of the year. Joining Buffett on the dais will be Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, likely tasked with the role of Buffett\u2019s successor as CEO, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, who runs the company\u2019s insurance operations. Together they will answer questions small and large: Can the stock beat the S&P 500 index? Why have share repurchases declined since 2021? Can the company\u2019s new management prove anywhere as capable as Buffett? Should Berkshire break up?\r  \n\r  \nBut really, everyone will be focused on the same thing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhether it\u2019s said out loud or not, succession is front and center on the minds of investors,\u201d says Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst.\r  \n\r  \nThere is nothing like Berkshire. It has had an extraordinary run since Buffett took control of a struggling textile maker in 1965 and turned it into the world\u2019s largest conglomerate, with nearly 400,000 employees and U.S.-centric businesses that offer one of the best reads on the health of the economy. Some of its largest divisions are the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad; Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which operates a multistate electric utility business that is one of the largest producers of green power in the country; and the world\u2019s biggest property and casualty insurer, including Geico, the No. 3 auto insurer.\r  \n\r  \nThere are smaller units, such as NetJets, the leader in private jet travel; Clayton Homes, the top maker of manufactured housing; Benjamin Moore paints; Dairy Queen; and one of the largest real estate brokerage businesses in the country. Then there is a $360 billion equity portfolio led by Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Berkshire\u2019s holdings. There also is what Buffett calls a Fort Knox balance sheet, with nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire isn\u2019t run like other conglomerates. It is unusually decentralized, with Buffett leaving key decisions at subsidiaries largely to the managers of the individual companies. He wrote in the Berkshire \u201cOwner\u2019s Manual\u201d in 2017 that \u201cwe delegate almost to the point of abdication.\u201d Berkshire has a tiny headquarters staff of 26 with no corporate counsel, investor relations, or public relations staff.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire\u2019s unusual strategy has worked. The company is expected to generate $40 billion of after-tax operating earnings this year and has a market capitalization of $880 billion, the seventh-largest in the stock market. The company\u2019s Class A stock has risen to over $600,000 a share from $20 (there have been no stock splits along the way) since Buffett took over in 1965, and holders who bought the now widely held Class B shares when they were created in 1996 have seen that stock rise 20-fold. It\u2019s one of the most widely held stocks by individuals, with some three million shareholders. Probably no other company elicits the passion and loyalty of its investor base. Big institutions have never appreciated the stock as much as individuals.\r  \n\r  \nBut will they continue to, once Buffett is no longer running the show? So central is Buffett to Berkshire\u2019s business that four or five people will take over the role that he maintained until 2018, when he delegated responsibility for Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses to Abel and the insurance operations to Jain.\r  \n\r  \nAbel is due to become CEO, which involves overseeing Berkshire\u2019s vast array of businesses and likely determining capital allocation, a critical role at the company that Buffett has performed so well for nearly 60 years. That means deciding whether to use earnings to repurchase stock, pay dividends, build cash, or make acquisitions. Jain is likely to remain head of the insurance business, while Buffett\u2019s older son, Howard, 69, a farmer and philanthropist, probably will become nonexecutive chairman.\r  \n\r  \nThen there are Todd Combs, 53, and Ted Weschler, 61, who now run about 10% of Berkshire\u2019s equity investments and probably will run the entire portfolio. Berkshire doesn\u2019t say which stocks in the equity portfolio are run by Combs and Weschler, but Berkshire watchers think that many of the smaller holdings\u2014under $4 billion\u2014are theirs. These include Charter Communications, DaVita, Liberty Sirius XM, Amazon.com, Snowflake, Visa, and Mastercard. Buffett hasn\u2019t commented on their performance relative to the market since 2019\u2014when he said they were slightly behind it since joining the company more than a decade ago. We estimate that both are probably lagging behind the market since their tenures began, given the underperformance of some of their rumored holdings in recent years.\r  \n\r  \nInvestment manager Bill Smead, who heads the Smead Value fund, would like to hear from Combs and Weschler. \u201cNot introducing Todd and Ted is an unforgivable sin. If Warren dies tomorrow, they are the stockpickers, and they have never answered or been asked a question at the annual meeting.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCombs is a key member of the Berkshire bench and could be a backup to Abel as the Buffett successor or a potential successor to Abel as CEO. Combs has a good rapport with Buffett and has experience beyond investments as CEO of Geico for past four years and as a JPMorgan Chase board member. One candidate to succeed Jain as head of the insurance operations is Joe Brandon, who runs Alleghany, an insurer that Berkshire bought in 2022.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett\u2019s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett\u2019s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett\u2019s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\r  \n\r  \nAn important question, asked or not, is what will happen to Berkshire shares when Buffett steps down or dies. They may take a hit of perhaps 5% to 10%, as longtime holders cash out and investors worry that the Buffett magic will disappear. Buffett, though, has said he thinks the stock will go up on the day after his death as investors anticipate a value-enhancing corporate breakup.\r  \n\r  \nThere\u2019s a case to be made for a breakup. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest conglomerate at a time when conglomerates have fallen out of favor, with the likes of General Electric and United Technologies having broken up in recent years. For all of Buffett\u2019s investment acumen and business smarts, Berkshire stock is about even with the S&P 500 as measured by total return over the past 10 years and 20 years, Bloomberg calculations show. The stock has returned 12.4% annually over the past 10 years, against 12.5% for the S&P 500. Buffett has said that Berkshire needs to top it over time or investors should consider looking elsewhere.\r  \n\r  \nAll the massive outperformance came in Buffett\u2019s first 40 years at the helm, when the company was smaller and Buffett had a particularly hot investment hand, scooping up big stakes in companies like Coca-Cola and American Express at cheap prices. Size, too, is an impediment to outsize returns.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett hasn\u2019t had a lot of new winners in the past decade. The company\u2019s largest acquisition\u2014the 2016 purchase of Precision Castparts for $33 billion\u2014has been a bust. Buffett has had some misses in the stock market, selling a group of financial stocks including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase in 2020 and 2021 at about half their current prices. Of course, Apple has been a huge win with Berkshire\u2019s stake, now worth over $150 billion, compared with a cost of around $30 billion. But the iPhone giant is having a rough 2024, and its stock is down more than10% year to date.\r  \n\r  \nBerkshire shares look like a good bet to match or beat the S&P 500 even after Buffett leaves the scene. The stock now looks appealing, valued at 1.5 times its projected March 31 book value of nearly $400,000 per Class A share and for 22 times estimated 2024 earnings. (Berkshire is due to report its first-quarter results on May 4.) Berkshire is slightly expensive relative to its five-year average of 1.4 times book value. The stock is ahead of the market this year and over the past five years.\r  \n\r  \nBook value is an old-fashioned valuation measure but is still relevant for Berkshire because of its large insurance operations\u2014insurers still get valued on book\u2014and because it has been a historical yardstick for the company since Buffett took over.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett chooses to focus on intrinsic value but doesn\u2019t disclose his estimate of that figure. Buffett has said that book value is a greatly understated proxy for intrinsic value, although share repurchases at current prices do reduce book value, somewhat undercutting the use of that measurement.\r  \n\r  \nPost Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s stock is likely to be supported by steady growth in its earnings and shareholder equity over time. The company appears capable of high-single-digit annual growth in book value based on $40 billion of operating income after taxes and gains in the $360 billion equity portfolio. If the stock keeps pace with the growth in book value, it could show similar share price growth.\r  \n\r  \nA dividend is a good bet within a few years of Buffett\u2019s death. Why? It will help his successor disburse some of the annual operating earnings. Another reason is that investors won\u2019t be so tolerant of Berkshire holding so much cash\u2014a record $168 billion at year-end 2023\u2014without Buffett at the helm.\r  \n\r  \nChristopher Bloomstran, chief investment strategist at Semper Augustus Investment Group, wrote earlier this year that Berkshire stock could generate a 10% to 11% annualized return over the next 10 years, with annual share buybacks in the 2% to 3% range\u2014above the recent rate of 1% to 1.5%. He pegged intrinsic value at around $720,000 a share.\r  \n\r  \nUBS analyst Brian Meredith is one of the few Berkshire bulls among Wall Street analysts. He recently lifted his price target to about $722,000 per Class A share from $715,000. He sees improvement at both Geico and Burlington Northern. Berkshire is one of the most defensive big stocks in the market, given its balance sheet and earnings power. A market selloff could offer opportunities for Buffett.\r  \n\r  \nBuffett is firmly against a breakup. He argues the conglomerate structure has numerous attributes, including tax benefits from the ability to quickly make use of any big catastrophe losses at Berkshire\u2019s insurance companies. Buffett has expressed confidence in the company\u2019s future, writing last year that \u201cBerkshire has been built to last.\u201d And the company\u2019s Buffett-friendly 14-member board\u2014including two of Buffett\u2019s kids\u2014is well aware of his views.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBerkshire has been run with enormous transparency, integrity, a long-term orientation, and a culture of stewardship. It is run by the greatest investor in history. That\u2019s the present,\u201d Chris Davis, an investment manager and Berkshire board member, told Barron\u2019s last year. \u201cAs for the future, every activist and investment banker will argue that in a world without Warren and Charlie, Berkshire\u2019s unorthodox structure shouldn\u2019t persist. I think it\u2019s worth defending.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWhatever the questions, Berkshire shareholders will savor the annual meeting, knowing there may not be many more with Buffett at the helm. As for the stock, many may heed the advice of Munger, who said that \u201cthey should keep the faith\u201d rather than sell after he and Buffett are gone.",

        "post_body": "**Warren Buffett or Not, Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is Built to Last**\r  \nQuestions are swirling about succession, a possible dividend, even a breakup of the company. The case for buying the stock now.\r  \nBy \r Andrew Bary\r  \nUpdated April 26, 2024, 2:25 pm EDT / Original April 26, 2024, 12:30 am EDT\n\n==============================\n\n**Article Preview:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ce018n/barrons\\_26th\\_april\\_warren\\_buffett\\_or\\_not/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ce018n/barrons_26th_april_warren_buffett_or_not/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n==============================  \n\n\n**Article Link:** https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-stock-price-warren-buffett-succession-4ab47394?mod=hp\\_HERO\n\n\r  \n==============================  \n\n\n**Quote**:\n\nBuffett\u2019s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett\u2019s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett\u2019s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See\u2019s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over\u2014all longtime friends of Buffett\u2014and they all are dead: Munger, David \u201cSandy\u201d Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year\u2019s meeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat won\u2019t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire\u2019s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you\u2019re gone?\r  \n\r  \nBuffett says he expects tough questions. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we like it,\u201d he wrote earlier this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,\u201d says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don\u2019t want them, in part for tax reasons.\n\n========================================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

The only stakeholder, who would benefit from that is China by ensuring the regional plant remains to be the global export hub. It will be in line with CP policy to support exports and bolstering local industries. Maybe there was a last minute invention and someone bought a lot of shares to compensate Tesla not producing cars in India.",

However the useless CEO has been kicked out which makes this a potential recovery play IF a new good CEO is found that does the following:\n\n- Stops wasting capex on poor ROIC projects like small games and other stuff\n\n- Focuses their investment on fixing Payday3 and making it actually something decent.\n\n- Immediately cancels the Dungeons and Dragons shit IP they have bought (really they should focus on multiplayer shooting games only...)\n\n- Shuts down the third party publishing business\n\n- Fires 50% of the team\n\nThis is kind of similar to Meta in 2022, investors were pricing in zuckerberg just continuing to act like a robot and throwing money down the train at VR.\n\nIf a good CEO is found it's possible this could change.\n\nWhat the new CEO needs to do it fire a bunch of people as soon as they join and streamline the company.\n\nThe issue is they have an interim CEO who was an old board member and looks useless as well to me.\n\nThe question is, how much is the Payday brand still worth after they fucked up Payday3 SO badly?\n\nPayday3 only has 200 concurrent players now, whereas Payday2 has 17k. Even though it's an old title it still retains huge numbers and will still generate profit with more DLC.\n\nThoughts? I think this all depends on the new CEO but this looks like one of the situations where it probably can't get any worse given they have no debt, new potential management and cash on hand IF they get a good perm CEO\n\nI think this is worth putting on a watchlist and waiting if a new CEO comes in that isn't an idiot.\n\n>**The Board of Directors of Starbreeze has appointed the current board member Juergen Goeldner as interim CEO of Starbreeze, taking office with immediate effect.

It continues to turn Google Cloud into another quickly growing business with ample operating leverage. It continues to rapidly iterate in GenAI search. And? It continues to be one of the most iconic performers of the 21st century. Congratulations to shareholders on more profitable compounding.\n\nf. Microsoft's Take\n\nLike Google, Microsoft is second to none in terms of consistent execution and drama-less profitable compounding.

One reason could be the reduced housing starts this year compare to past years.\n\nHere is a google sheet with the date of both companies:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\\_WpshSYBc2Y8-uZWsrJRPAy63DFUkKhF12TJhHfvFc4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTell me which would you invest in, if the share price were to drop and offer you a good entry price?\n\n(disclosure, i have a tiny tracker position in SSD)\n\n&#x200B;",

Fastenal is paying out the bulk of its free cash flow as dividends, the dividend ratio is approaching 70% and it has been growing its dividend at a rate of 12% a year for the last 10 years. In fact, Fastenal just made it to the Dividend Aristocrat list, companies which has increased its dividend every year for the last 25 years.\n\nI look at the slowing growth of Fastenal and the need to payout so much of the earnings to dividends plus the need to increase the dividend annually as quite stressful when compared to Simpson Mfg, where the payout ratio is only 30% and the annualized dividend increase is about been 7%. \n\nBottom line, SSD has got more potential upside to be rated at a higher multiple than FAST whereas for Fast, if the business slows down too much, and they cannot increase their dividend, the stock will fall quite dramatically as the dividend investors move elsewhere.\n\nDo you agree with my assessment ?",

        "post_body": "Heading into earnings, I can't help but think Apple is the best deep value play of the mega cap stocks out there because of its fortress balance sheet. I expect more share repurchases to be announced with earnings, which should continue to help juice EPS.\n\nI'm not understanding why the market is ignoring the massive share repurchases the company continues to do. Apple bought back ~1.5 billion shares in the past three years alone, having spent:\n- $82.6 billion in 2021\n- $89.6 billion in 2022\n- $79.2 billion in 2023\n\nLast quarter they ended with $173 billion in cash/marketable securities versus $108 billion in debt. The CFO reiterated the long-term plan to go cash neutral. So with a net cash position of $65 billion, I expect Apple bought back a significant chunk of shares in Q1 and might even be a record for share repurchases last quarter.\n\nI know iPhone growth isn't encouraging, but services continue to grow at a double digit clip. With the share repurchases and healthy growth in services, why isn't Apple trading at a higher multiple? To me it seems like a deep value play relative to the other mega cap stocks and a no brainer to buy and hold. \n\nWhy is the market relatively so bearish on Apple?",

Its P/E may be high, but so is Costco whose P/E is twice that of Apple.\n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of people will disagree with this example, but I think my point still stands\u2026 Apple is so ingrained in the culture and has such a strong brand identity\u2026 that a P/E ratio of 25 makes it a value play.\n\nAlso\u2026 don\u2019t give me any of that bs about teens being fickle. If teens today feel iPhones are aspirational, they\u2019ll feel the same way as adults. There are plenty of examples from history that illustrate this.

I also think it trades OTC in the US as well, they are most known for being the publishers of hotline miami.\n\nThey IPO'd 2.5 years ago and have crashed since because some of their games flopped and previous management didn't do so well. They had a huge 2022 net loss due to impairment which means they invested a lot of money into some really poor games.\n\nWhat's interesting about them is they have:\n\n* No debt\n* A lot of cash\n* A terribly low share price\n* Management has very large stakes in the company and is incentivzed\n* New management is the original founders who made it successful in the first place\n* A back catalogue such as cult of the lamb which continues to produce them decent revenues\n* Most importantly they have some upcoming games that could be big hits, Human Fall Flat 2, Plucky Squire (my personal favourite, it looks similar to 'It Takes Two', Baby Steps (made by the creator of 'Getting Over It' which is massive), Anger Foot (I have played the demo and it's really really fun, the soundtrack is amazing) etc.\n\nManagement has delayed the above releases to make sure they invest in them correctly so they are big hits like cult of the lamb was, i.e they need to hit an 85%+ on Metacritic and 'very positive' reviews on steam for a game to really have a chance of being big.\n\nDevolver digital are well known for high quality games.\n\nSome potential risks:\n\n* They need to stop acquiring any more companies or they run the risk of destroying value by overpaying, although most games companies are at all time lows to be fair.\n* They have to make sure the above games are hits, if not their stock price will tank even further.\n* The stock is very illiquid, it's very hard to buy so put small limit orders in if you do decide.\n* Games companies are a bit like gambling with the odds on your side, they have lumpy revenues and need hits to keep growing, obviously if these games flop it's a disaster.\n\nHave a look into it\n\nThanks",

        "post_body": "Hello all! I'm a college student who got into value investing around 2020. I've slowly been learning more as I go along, and I'd like some opinions on my portfolio\n\nDIS-40%. This is easily my biggest investment, and for good reason. The business itself has survived through multiple financial crisis, multiple leadership crisis, and a global pandemic, and is now in a state where they can fully take advantage of the market. Their park business is one of the best businesses out there, with a great moat, solid earnings, and great margins. The linear business has shown resilience in the face of cord cutting, the DTC business is really beginning to show its fruits, and could be a real driver of growth. Even if Disney+ fails, worst case, they can make a lot bidding their content away to the highest bidders on streaming, with players like Netflix, AppleTV, and Prime Video bidding the content price up. IMO, this is still very undervalued for how good of a business it is. \n\nINTC-16.5%. Another great business. Their revenue and earnings slowdown mainly come from a global demand shortage for consumer CPUs, which will begin to pick up in the future. Pat Gelsinger has proven to be a great CEO while at VMWare, and the business is currently priced as if the revenue growth will only come from the foundry business. The foundry part of the business has been operating for the entirety of Intel's history losing money, it's only that now that it's independent of the CPU arm that people are focusing on it. Worst case, they spin off the foundry business and become fabless. With their connections, strong revenue, and overall dominance over the CPU market, that business will still prove to be extremely strong. \n\nTCEHY-13%. This is less a bet on China and more a bet on Pony Ma and his investment acumen. Pony Ma has proven himself an extremely good executive, and with the vast, diverse, strong, and high margin business that spans international markets, this is a great business to buy. China is easing restrictions and wants foreign dollars again, which is proving itself in a recent semi-rally in Chinese stocks.\n\nCVS-10.5%. This is the business I'm the most likely to sell. I bought in because the revenue growth and overall business seems strong, but they bought a lot of that revenue growth, and the regulatory environment has turned SHARPLY against them. It seems increasingly likely that their core business will get attacked by competitors, and leadership at the company doesn't exactly spark confidence like other companies do. Increasingly seeming like a value trap. \n\nSOFI-10%. This is less of a bank and more of an overall financial stock. It's proven to be a great grower, and the company was trading at its TBVPS, so I bought in. Leadership knows what direction they're going in, and understand exactly how to funnel customers into their pipeline. \n\nBABA-8.5%. Another China bet. This comes from the overall strength of the balance sheet, the share buybacks, and the potential that BABA has in the cloud and international markets. I'd hope to see Jack Ma be allowed to come back to BABA, but that's unlikely. Still, with China easing restrictions, this company is increasingly seeming like a company people can actually invest in again. \n\nWMG-1%. This is more of a temporary percent. I plan on buying more in the future, but it seems like the price has been falling, so I'm waiting for more of an entry. Robert Kynci is a great executive and really helped to make YouTube what it is today. They are embracing tech more than any of the other large labels, and the business is in a state of really transforming towards the modern music market, while the other 2 major labels remain a bit stuck in their ways. Music is also an industry that is likely to see rapid growth based on the growth of Vinyl, streaming, and overall merchandising of artists. Data has continually shown that Gen-Z spends significantly more on experiences and wants to support artists, which provides a great opportunity for WMG. Don't let the temporary metrics stray you away from this business, as it's a great opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if the percentages don't add up. I'm rounding a bit with this. Thanks for free opinions here.",

Your analysis of DIS shows nothing the market does not already know - outsize positions should be reserved for those with a hidden something the market is yet to discover\n\n3. Your INTC analysis has \"great business\" and \"slowdown\" within a few words of each other. Nowhere in your analysis is any discussion of the reliance on subsidies to prop up and \"grow\"\n\n4. Your TCEHY analysis is confused: you say it is a bet on Pony Ma and end up discussing China's need for dollars? You'd be better off talking about how you think they'll monetise WeChat, how they'll meet the challenge of TikTok, how they'll leverage gaming to boost their cloud business. If I was betting on leaders like you are here, I'd be one of the funds bag holding Twitter with Elon right now\n\n5. CVS analysis focuses on the risks - why? Because the share price is down 20% recently? If you're investing in single names you need to do what Buffett did at AMX in the face of the salad oil scandal: understand the risks and understand what the market doesn't and buy it when it's down 50%. Your analysis shows me you'll be selling low and buying the next boat that's already being pushed by a rising tide, rather than buying the one that's beached and patiently waiting for the tide that's about to come in\n\n6. Your bullish view of SOFI means you don't discuss its purchase of banks (you criticise acquisitions elsewhere) nor its risk due to Biden's action on student loans (you mention ss a negative the regulation changes facing CVS, but not here?). You are betraying your biases. Investing should be done in a very cold way, applying the same standards everywhere. What are the risks facing this company? Why isn't it making money consistently? You don't answer the basics. Better off in an ETF that invests in the theme you bought this for. \n\n7. BABA is \"another China bet\" - I thought you said TCEHY wasn't a China bet? Again, your spitting what everyone knows: cloud, international. Surprised you didn't mention AI. If you want a China theme, you can get it via an ETF, but by punting in two names you're taking a risk of unknown proportion. You might come back in three years and your 22% in these two names has doubled and is now 30% of the portfolio. You'll be patting yourself on the back, and wondering why they aren't 44% of the portfolio seeing as they doubled...\n\n8. You're betting only 1% of your portfolio on WMG? which is trading at about 20x EV/EBITDA? This is so out of character: with that level of ovevaluation I'd expect this to be at least 20% of your portfolio\n\nI'd be liquidating everything and investing in low cost thematic ETFs. Find one for streaming (DIS, WMG), find one for China and Emerging Markets (TCEHY, BABA), find one for fin tech (TCEHY, SOFI), find one for healthcare (CVS), funds one for semis (INTC). That's five so 20% in each. And next time you see a company you like, find an ETF for it and make sure it's not an already existing theme in your portfolio and trim your existing winners to invest in the new one. Keep doing that until you have enough ETFs that don't duplicate risks. Rebalance regularly, trimming winners and adding to losers. \n\nYou asked for free opinions, and these only cost 2 cents.",

The advantages of being a huge corporation rather than an indie studio in terms of getting an audience in has shrunk\n\n3. Audiences are far more aware of which movies are OK or good from social media and avoiding them in theaters and waiting for streaming. They are only going to movies that their friends rave about.\n\n4. There is growing international competition in entertainment and we are all now aware from various pieces of media that audiences are open to Korean or Japanese cinema and TV. Much of this seems to be made more efficiently than hollywood.\n\n5. The parks depend on producing great work, great characters and stories that resonate. Disney is failing to do this.",

Intel has continuously been late to the party and lost much of the market share they once had, I just don\u2019t see them as a turn around story, value trap imo. Disney has probably the most valuable  IPs in the world, yet their quality just isn\u2019t there and they seem to be in a big slump, yet in the long run I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be fine I just personally hate the company. I do like the SOFI pick a lot, better margins then any brick and mortar bank and their tech revenue is expected to grow 100% yoy, Monday will be a big day for the company as continued profitability imo is essential for the near term outlook on the stock, do find it very undervalued at this price, especially with Noto\u2019s 2026 projections. As for CVS I think it\u2019s a pretty bad stock, and overall crappy company, wouldn\u2019t wanna invest in a sleazy company like that. I got a couple of recommendations stock wise, but I\u2019ve rambled on enough for this comment lol",

Look at market share under Gelsinger; It's only gone up, and that's going against the extremely well run AMD.

Yeah, Disney's recent slate has sucked, and they've certainly done a poor job with the film IP of Star wars, but guess what? That's all temporary. Those are things that are incredibly easy to fix. And Disney executives have recognized this, and are actively making shifts. Disney understands that they'll need to begin production of original IP, or pull from other source material(like WB with Dune), and eventually they will.

        "post_date": "2024-04-25T06:17:43",
        "post_body": "\n**Key Insights:**  \nFLIC has shown remarkable resilience during major financial crises, including the 2008 global financial meltdown and the recent 2023 turmoil in the regional banking sector. Despite these strengths, its stock has been overlooked and is currently trading at levels similar to those seen in 2008-2009. When getting into the weeds you'll see FLIC has tons of liquidity, zero doubtful rated loans on the books, rock solid dividend yield and history, insiders consistently buying shares, corporate buy backs, owns the real estate of at least 20 of their 40 branch locations (in NYC/Long Island), upcoming earnings (after the bell today) and dirt-cheap options (low volume though so be careful).\n\n* **Aggressive Buybacks:** With a continuous $15 million buyback program and hefty insider purchases, there's a clear signal that those in the know believe in FLIC\u2019s future.\n\n* **Affordable Options:** The options market for FLIC is invitingly priced, providing a cost-effective way to potentially profit from future stock movements, just be careful as they are low volume typically. Hopefully we will see an uptick with earnings today.\n\n* **Proven Stability:** FLIC has navigated past financial storms with strategy and grace, bolstered by recent tech upgrades in fintech and cybersecurity.\n\n* **Financial Health:** Solid capital ratios underpin its ability to maintain operations and seek growth, enhancing its appeal as a robust investment.\n\n* **Attractive Dividend Yield:** For those looking for reliable income, FLIC\u2019s strong track record of dividends is a major draw, especially if you\u2019ve been burned by riskier bets this week. At first glance the yield at nearly 8% may appear unsustainable but when doing you DD you'll see that it is a sustainable number and the stock is just cheap at the moment.\n\n* **Valuation and Earnings:** Given the ongoing buybacks, insider enthusiasm, and strong fundamentals, my target price of around $17.40 based on a P/E of 15 and an EPS of $1.16 seems achievable for this stock before the end of the year. FLIC's annual report pegs the book value at $16.83/share which you can see in their SEC filing and I believe once the regional banking sector rebounds FLIC will get right back to $17+. \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nFLIC\u2019s blend of strategic buybacks, insider confidence, and significant movement on small volume, alongside its solid financials and undervalued options, make it an intriguing prospect for those looking for a mix of safety and growth in the financial sector.\n\nBut bottom line: it's undervalued and the company has been around 100 years.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is for informational purposes only, not financial advice. Always do your own research or consult a professional.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 290 Shares\n* 10 \u2013 9/20 $10 C\n* 5 \u2013 12/20 $12.50 C",

E.g. Taylor Swift eras tour, the APE saga where he raised money through issuance even when shareholders didn't want to let him etc.\n\nReasons for pause:\n\n* It has a massive, unsustainable debt load - 4.5B total, of which \\~3B is due in 2 years. They will need to refinance, but the terms will likely be onerous.\n* Liabilities exceed assets by 1.8B, so the company is basically at the mercy of the senior lenders\n* The writers' and actors' strikes did a number on box office revenue for at least two quarters - so far\n* Management has no qualms raising money through share issuance, which has diluted shareholders down the drain (\\~20X over 3 years). There's a $250M issuance underway which would dilute by another 25%\n* The CEO does dumb shit like buying a gold mine, time to time\n\nI have AMC as a potential investment as I like the company, but the stock can suck for a bit longer.

Operating Income is different from EBIT, and therefore my intuitition tells me that using one or the other has consequences for the later valuation process with, for example, companies that have a significant amount of earnings from non-operating activities investments or credit lending. Is this correct?",

        "post_body": "I originally viewed TDM as a plantation Group with a healthcare arm. About 17 years ago, the healthcare segment only accounted for about 16% of the Group revenue. The Group plantation operations then was mainly in Malaysia and this accounted for a large part of the Group\u2019s revenue. \n\nThe Group decided to expand it plantations segment by venturing to Indonesia. It took several years to get this going such that the maiden revenue from the Indonesian plantation was only in 2013. By then  the Group had \u201c..earmarked that the growth of the plantation operations will be in Kalimantan.\u201d \n\nBut things began to go wrong with the Indonesian operations soon after. The losses and impairments got so bad that the Group announced its plans to sell the Indonesian assets in 2019.  By 2023 it was still trying to complete the sale of its Indonesian assets. \n\nIf not for the healthcare segment, which had grown to account for 56 % of the Group\u2019s revenue in 2023, TDM would be in a worse shape.\n\nMoral of the story? Beware of companies announcing expanding into foreign countries as the Malaysian experience may not always be transferable. \n\nGiven the poor plantation segment performance, the market took a dim view of the company despite a growing healthcare segment. I guess the market is still waiting for TDM to prove that it can recover from the Indonesian lesson. \n\nRefer to \u201cIs TDM a value trap?\u201d if you want to bet on its turnaround. \n\n[https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more](https://www.i4value.asia/2024/04/is-tdm-value-trap.html#more)",

        "post_body": "(Downvote if you do not want to see this type of articles. Do not downvote because you do not agree with the article)\n\n**A Value Investor\u2019s Guide to Navigating Technology Disruption**\n\nBy Mark Iong\r \n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/value-investing-technology-stocks-s-curve-40230f6a?mod=djem\\_b\\_Weekly%20Barrons%20feed%20for%20last%2024%20hours\n\nTectonic shifts occur more frequently in technology than in other sectors, so investors need to be wary of tech companies that are approaching the mature stage of what is known as the S-curve.\r \n\nThis curve, shaped like the letter \u201cs,\u201d is a visual representation of the growth path that technology companies tend to follow. It begins with slow initial growth (the bottom of the \u201cs\u201d) then moves with rapid upward growth as adoption takes off, finally arriving at the plateau stage, at which businesses become increasingly commoditized, growth becomes saturated, and returns trend lower. Companies in the plateau stage of the S-curve often find it difficult to recapture their momentum, particularly in the tech sector, where megatrends tend to be irreversible. Consider the evolution of computer technology from mainframes to PCs and servers, to mobile and the cloud\u2014each development a paradigm shift that didn\u2019t reverse course and that rendered the previously used technology less favored and eventually obsolete. With artificial intelligence, a similar seismic shift is now under way.\r\n\nAs value investors, we naturally gravitate to the uppermost section of the S-curve. Quality companies often become undervalued by the market at this stage, providing the opportunity to buy at a significant discount relative to their long-term intrinsic value. But we need to be highly selective, identifying businesses that have the competitive moats and defensive characteristics that will extend the upward slope of the S-curve into the new technology frontier instead of entering the plateau stage.\r\n\nBy contrast, mature tech companies risk succumbing to the \u201cinnovator\u2019s dilemma,\u201d a term coined by the late academic and business consultant Clayton Christensen to describe how companies cling to their established markets and protect profit margins instead of focusing on innovations that might disrupt their core businesses but also open up new opportunities for growth. As new entrants exploit this complacency and carve out a niche in the market, legacy businesses eventually fall victim to a shrinking profit pool, as capital flows to new entrants that offer products with more power, efficiency, scalability, and affordability.\r\n\nWithout innovations to alter their weakening fundamental outlook, the old guard may see profits dwindle and their valuations deflate. It is a slow bleed, a value trap that lulls investors with seemingly cheap metrics but masks a bleak future. We feel it is important to avoid these long-term secular losers that might seem statistically cheap based on today\u2019s valuation. A company trading at a depressed price-to-earnings multiple, for example, could be \u201ccheap\u201d for a reason, reflecting a declining business where valuation could remain low indefinitely or worse, continue to compress.\r\n\nThere are several important traits we look for when evaluating maturing technology businesses. They need to be innovative with an eye toward the future, developing new products and services that can position them for the next paradigm shift. Management needs to be willing to disrupt themselves, even if doing so risks revenue and earnings losses in the near term. We witnessed several companies created in the early days of the internet, for instance, that successfully navigated their way into mobile computing in the 2010s and are now attempting to repeat the same playbook as they make strides in the AI era of the 2020s.\n\nPlatform companies are probably the best examples of businesses that are most adept at steering through disruptions. Such companies have an extensive ecosystem of first-party software and hardware products and third-party partners that rely on their platforms. Cloud computing exemplifies this dynamic today, where several players control the majority of the market and are essentially the gatekeepers for all things artificial intelligence and cloud computing. In technology subsectors such as semiconductors and enterprise software, we seek those firms with durable business models and robust product road maps that can serve as the foundational layers of the next megatrend.\r\n\nTechnology companies primed for long-term success understand that disruption is a marathon, not a sprint. Conversely, those that struggle to adapt and innovate are the ones most likely to stumble. Value investors who recognize this could be primed to take advantage of outperformance in the tech sector. \n\n============================\n\n&#x200B;",

Catheter Related Blood Infections plagues the End Stage Disease Population. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease Institute, nearly 808,000 people suffer from this ailment, and approximately 69% are on dialysis([https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:\\~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)))\r\n* Defencath is a catheter lock solution that eliminates both gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections that develop within the Catheter. Defencath is composed of a solution of taurolidine and heparin that effectively reduces the CRBSI events in this vulnerable population.\r\n* However, this population has a catheter that is surgically implanted into their patient and its called a, \u201cCentral Venous Catheter.\u201d This type of catheter is placed near a large center vein most commonly an internal jugular or subclavian. In layman terms, it\u2019s placed near the patient's heart, implanted on the patient to administer medication or to administer hemo-dialysis.\r\n* The results of their Lock-100 Study had 71% reduction in CRBIS compared to the control (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37678222/). Additionally, They rejected the null hypothesis by a P value of .0006 to such a degree that it would only occur in 1 in 10,000 tries due to sheer random chance. Therefore, the phase III study was halted.\r\n* There are approximately 250,000k CRBIS events per year according to this site,([https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:\\~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019))\r\n* You can check the company\u2019s most recent deck to see the potential impact of Defencath on CRBIS here, ([https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation\\_1-7-23.pdf](https://cormedix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CorMedix-Corp-Presentation_1-7-23.pdf))\r\n* **As of November 15, 2023 Cormedix received a NDA Approval by the FDA for the limited population of Adult patients affected by kidney failure**( [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/#:\\~:text=About%20CorMedix&text=DefenCath%20has%20been%20designated%20by,address%20an%20unmet%20medical%20need.)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/#:~:text=About%20CorMedix&text=DefenCath%20has%20been%20designated%20by,address%20an%20unmet%20medical%20need.)))\r\n* **As of January 30, and April 9th 2024, Cormedix secured CMS J-Codes for In-Patient and Outpatient settings**.( https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-and-reimbursement-updates/) and ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/))\r\n* **On April 19, 2024, Cormedix Also Secured TDAPA reimbursement from CMS for the Out-Patient Setting**([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/)).\r\n* Lastly: on April 15, 2024, Cormedix Celebrated their commercial launch for the in-patient setting, and expect to lauch out-patient by July 1st 2024.

Additionally, other insiders have not sold any shares over the past few years. I heavily weigh insider ownership whether they were paid for, awarded, or granted in lieu of payment.

The growth potential is HUGE!\r\n* **With such volume you\u2019re probably wondering at this point how precisely does the product work\u2026** Well, Every Time a patient receives hemo-dialysis the catheter must be flushed with the Defencath solution before and after. That is approximately two vials per patient per visit with the average patient getting about 3 treatments per-week, out of 550,000 patients on hemodialysis.\r\n* Cormedix plans, and is on track to launch Defencath for out-patient setting on July 1, 2024.\r\n* Cormedix Plans on expanding its usage and application of Defencath to other populations that already have CVCs, like Oncology.\r\n* The current short interest as of 3/31/24 is 34 million dollars or approx. 8.2 million shares.\r\n* **Marketing Plan**: There are 5 major companies that control the out-patient setting, and two of them control 70% of the market. Remember, Out-patient is projected to sell appx. 37 million vials!\r\n* The Projected market impact of the stock is incredible, and understanding the product shows the extreme value it holds.\r\n* **Debt:** the company has NO debt.\r\n* **Market Exclusivity:** CRMD has 10.5 years market exclusivity because it's a qualified infectious diseases, and it's a new chemical entity. And it\u2019s intellectual property is extended until April 15, 2024. See ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/))\r\n* **WHY WILL CRMD EXPLODE SOONER THAN ANALYISTS EXPECTATIONS?**\r\n* The out-patient setting is dominated by 5 major out-patient facilities, and once it received it's NDA every medical Journal posted the NDA approval AND JOE, MENTIONED THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING TO BOTH IN-PATIENT AND OUT PATIENT FACILITIES AT March 12th Earnings Call \"March 12, 2024 \"Joe Todisco, CorMedix CEO, commented, \u201cI am excited about the Company\u2019s recent progress as we have scaled up activity ahead of our commercial launch in April. **We have received significant inbound interest from both inpatient facilities as well as outpatient dialysis providers with respect to DefenCath, and we are actively engaged in customer discussions in both settings of care**\" ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:\\~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)))\r\n* **Competition:** There is no Drug on the market that prevents CRBIs the way Cormedix does and there is absolutely no competition.\r\n* The CTXR guys will say we\u2019re competition but we\u2019re not. Mino-lock salvages an already infected Catheter. It\u2019s a reactive medicine opposed to Defencath which is Preventative.\r\n   * The preventative application allows for such high sales values in such an exclusive market.\r\n* **CREDIT TO Fretwizard125,** \u201cGood post and summary of what\u2019s in play here. I\u2019ve been in CRMD since 2018 and Have been accumulating. Have a multi-hundred thousand dollar position and am waiting for this to explode. With TDAPA we could see 70-80% market penetration really quickly, (1-2 years).\r\n   * The Wholesale Acquisition Price FROM CRMD and approved by CMS is $250/vial. They will likely offer discounts to the providers to adopt and recognize revenue too. But even with a 70% discount for a vial potential revenue is insane.\r\n   * Quick math $75/vial x20,000,000 vials (50% penetration) =$1.5b. Yes billion, with a B.\r\n   * This does not include other indications they are trying to expand into including oncology and TPN. Oncology market is 1.5x the size of hemodialysis. This is a long term hold with literally the most perfect commercialization setup I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d--- Credit to Fretwizard 125\r\n* Projected Price: Low $9.00 per share, medium is $12.00 per share; high of $19.00 per share within the next year. I believe we\u2019re going to hit the 9s in july and potentially hit 20s before December.\r\n* **TLDR:** Cormedix(CRMD) Is Deep Value. It hit\u2019s all of the marks. CRMD is poised for huge growth over the next year, reaching over a billion sales. The market is unique, and they\u2019re going to be the standard of care. The stock is primed to explode at any day. I believe the stock will be at least 25$ per share by March 2025 if not $35-$40 per share. 5 Major companies control 100% of the out-patient market. They\u2019ll be announcing contracts in the coming weeks. I think we can hit 12$ before the out-patient launch in July, that\u2019s my opinion.\r\n* **All RISK IS ELIMINATED!**\r\n* **POSITION:**\r\n   * 50 call contracts $6 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K Exp. June 21\r\n   * 50 call Contracts $7 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K exp June 21\r\n   * 3750 Shares average $4.15. (have a little bit of higher average because of options trading throughout the past 3 years.)",

I don't know about the USA, but in my professional experience by far the most people with end stage renal disease have an arteriovenous shunt, and NOT a catheter. Having a (central venous) catheter is usually just for temporary dialysis, or as a bridge to getting a shunt or a peritoneal dialysis catheter (which is not a central venous catheter).

However a lot of the risk in this stock has decreased due to the factors mentioned in op's DD. such as FDA approval, TDAPA approval and clinical trials. The company signed a contract before the product was officially launched. I think that is a sign that the stock is going to follow the trajectory of OP's DD",

By interpreting financial data visually in the key areas outlined below, we can more easily identify businesses with the potential for sustained growth and value creation over the long term.\n\n* Price and Volatility: Understand the risk profile and market perception of a company\n* Income Statement and Balance Sheet: Understand the company's earnings, assets, and financial health.\n* Valuation: Assess the value of a company relative to its peers and industry.\n* Return of Value: Explore a company's strategy for returning value to shareholders.\n* Industry Comparison: Benchmark a company against its direct competitors. \n\n [How Hershey Can Be Your Golden Ticket for Evaluating Investment Opportunities](https://quartest.substack.com/p/how-hershey-can-be-your-golden-ticket-90b)\n\nI have been developing this financial framework for analyzing stocks for quite some time now and thought you all might be interested in it. I would also greatly appreciate your feedback on the analysis and my writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR Summary of my Hershey Analysis:\n\nHershey's consistent revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth have historically warranted a premium valuation to the market. The financial strength and resilience of the business have consistently placed Hershey as a top performing in the consumer staples sector. These returns have been well justified, as Hershey has continually demonstrated efficient uses capital, as evidenced by its high return on invested capital, equity, and assets. Its attractive return strategy, including dividend payouts and share buybacks, have provided a sound value return for shareholders.  \nHowever, Hershey has recently been faced with perceived challenges in maintaining sustainable earnings growth in an inflationary environment with skyrocketing cocoa prices and tough competition from snacking rivals. While Hershey's five-year historical EPS growth lags behind some competitors and has recently slowed, its valuation has potentially come down to reasonable levels given the quality of the business and its strong cash flow generation. Nevertheless, Hershey's ability to navigate external factors including  market dynamics and further cost fluctuations in its inputs, will be crucial to the company's long-term success.\n\n",

There\u2019s also climate controlled solutions which would take more capital but remains an option.\n\nAdditionally, at 11% cocoa use, Hersheys chocolate is 1% above the legal threshold to call it chocolate.

As UCACashFlow pointed out, Hershey is very well positioned in their Candy, Mints and Gum (CMG) segment with strong brands and supply advantages. They are further expanding into healthy snacks and despite a slowdown in their most recent quarter due to distribution and inventory, they have seen success with acquisitions there. \nSo is it a potential cause for concern, yes.

However, it's not suitable for the majority of retail investors.\n\nI generally wouldn't recommend active stock picking for most retail investors. The more you learn about it, the clearer it becomes that active investing isn't the best strategy for the majority. Instead, retail investors should focus on passive investing through diversified ETFs, understanding risks, diversification, and proper portfolio or asset allocation. Most importantly, they should get to know their own investor behavior.\n\nUnderstanding one's risk tolerance and creating a long-term, sustainable investment strategy that one can live with is crucial. For those still keen on learning about stock picking, it might be wise to limit this to about 5% of the portfolio. This can help mitigate the risk of capital loss while still allowing for significant learning outcomes in comparison to their broader market portfolio.\n\nI emphasize passive investment because there is strong empirical evidence showing that the market outperforms 80-95% of institutional investors after fees over any 10-year rolling period.

        "post_date": "2024-04-22T08:03:02",
        "post_body": "This week, I feel compelled to acquaint those unfamiliar with Benjamin Graham, the cornerstone figure of value investing. \n\nRegarded as the \u201cFather\u201d of this discipline, his seminal works, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, serve as indispensable guides for investors. Graham\u2019s principles laid the groundwork for the legends of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and continue to inspire legions of aspiring investors.\n\n>  \u201cThe intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\u201d  - Benjamin Graham\n\n# The Teachings of Benjamin Graham\nGraham imparted numerous invaluable lessons, but today, I wish to highlight three that I consider pivotal for enhancing one\u2019s investment acumen:\n\n## 1. Invest in the company, not the share price\nWhen we purchase just one stock of a listed company, it is no different from buying the entire business. That one share gives us ownership rights of the company, including a proportionate share of the company\u2019s profits. So we are NOT buying a share but rather a company.\n\nIt may seem like I am stating the obvious. Yet, even today, people trade stocks because of their volatility rather than the underlying fundamentals of that business, and even \u201cinvestors\u201d quickly overlook the basics of a company because they don\u2019t want to miss out on the latest trend.\n\nWhile there are stories of success trading stock and people retiring early because of  \u201cthe next big thing,\u201d there are far more stories of going broke due to the same strategies. Unfortunately, those stories are seldom in the media, posted on social media or spoken about over the dinner table.\n\nIf we want to be successful investors, we must understand the company we are buying, how it generates revenue, the costs to run it, and the risks involved. The more we know, the more confident we will be when we invest, and although that doesn\u2019t guarantee success, it dramatically improves it.\n\n## 2. Invest at less than it is worth.\nGraham, being an investor during the Great Depression, was always acutely aware of the risks of investing in the stock market and how easily fortunes could be lost. Therefore, he believed in investing with a Margin of Safety, which means buying shares in a company at a discount to its true worth or intrinsic value.\n\nIn Investing Chronicles above, we discussed the historical average P/E of the S&P 500, which is around 20.5, meaning that, on average, the price of the S&P 500 is roughly 20x the combined earnings of its constituents. If we assume this is the fair value of the index, then whenever the index is trading below 20x earnings, we have a margin of safety. The lower the P/E, the greater the margin of safety.\n\nSimilarly, for a company, once we have analysed the business and its economic drivers, we should be in a decent position to derive an estimate of its intrinsic value. If we believe the company to be worth $100 million and the market currently values it at $150 million, why would we purchase shares?\n\nHowever, the opportunity is evident if that company has a current value (market cap) of $75 million. More importantly, buying it at $75 million provides us with a safety net because our calculations might be off (almost guaranteed they are), and the company\u2019s actual value could be $80 million. Of course, the actual value could be $120 million, but you get the point!\n\n## 3. Let the Market Come to You\nBesides \u201cMargin of Safety\u201d, Graham is also famous for coining the term \u201cMr Market\u201d, referring to the bipolar nature of the stock market.\n\nIn the stock exchange, as with all things involving human beings, emotions get involved, and one could argue that when money is involved, we get highly emotional. The higher the emotional charge, the higher the capacity to act irrationally.\n\nEuphoria will likely occur when share prices appreciate and money is made. Market participants throw caution to the wind during these times, feeling nothing can go wrong. As a result, investors overpay for assets. We can see this currently, at least in my opinion, as certain tech stocks are valued as though the stars have aligned.\n\nOf course, the opposite is true too, when fear takes grip. During these times, irrational, pessimistic market participants convince themselves that they will lose all their money and sell while running for the hills, screaming, \u201cThe sky is falling\u201d. During these times, valuations can plummet to illogical lows.\n\nOur goal is to remove our emotions when investing.\n\nInvesting in the long term is a fantastic strategy because it allows us to ignore short-term market noise and fluctuations, especially if we understand what we have bought. We are in a hugely advantageous position to take advantage of Mr Market, buying when fear is at its peak and selling to the overzealous buyer.\n\n# Summary\nSo be more like the Father of Investing:\n\n- Know what you are buying,\n- Know what it is worth, and\n- Only buy it when you can get a substantial discount.\n\nIf you can master the above, you are well on your way to being better than most.\n\nHope you enjoyed this.

But even if he did and I\u2019m not aware, you also have to take the context of the P/E into account\u2026.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked at it but let\u2019s say you are correct about historic P/E being at 20x. Okay. But that was before companies were buying back shares (and retiring those shares) like crazy. That means there are less shares of quality companies to go around. While in a vacuum the P/E should not change with shares bought back, you aren\u2019t considering the DEMAND for those shares staying the same or even increasing. There are plenty of research papers arguing that due to the prevalence of share buybacks we may be entering a world where higher P/Es are standard, at least for a while. \n\nAlso, I would say that China\u2019s current low P/E is NO indication of \u201ccheapness\u201d but rather of lack of quality and higher risk.",

So when you buy directly comparable companies at 20x multiples vs 30x multiples, and the price falls for both, you're more likely to lose more money on the 30x multiples company than on the 20x multiples company simply because you can assume a baseline at constant earnings.\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the company's earnings being stable - a company with volatile earnings cannot be measured like this.",

If 2 companies in the same industry have dramatically different valuations, then there's usually many reasons for that difference. It could be very well the case that the lower price multiple company is more risky during a time of duress. For example, jp morgan vs all the smaller/medium sized banks in the last couple of years.\n\nThe value principle here is that by taking on more risks in those lower price multiple companies, you also raise your expected return.",

Nvidia has been nearly alone on the field, with more than 90% market share.\r  \n\r  \nBut fresh competition is coming\u2014from companies big and small\u2014and the battle will be fierce. The stakes couldn\u2019t be bigger: Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has sized the AI chip market at $400 billion by 2027. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That\u2019s almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.\n\n. . . . . . \n\nA few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make\u2014or, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.\r  \n\r  \nHuang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren\u2019t the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well\u2014or better\u2014than Nvidia.\n\n. . . . . \n\nNvidia\u2019s rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won\u2019t be winner-take-all. It isn\u2019t game over. It\u2019s game on.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia\u2019s most obvious challengers are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\n\n. . . . . . . ",

Note that they\u2019ve been like this long before the war so thats not the obvious of what I\u2019m missing. Two examples are PERI and INMD. Its like they are almost too perfect. Whats the deal? Why see they valued so low when their fundamentals are growing at impressive rates? \n\nIf these were US companies I would be in fully but clearly theres something I don\u2019t understand about Israeli companies because the only thing they have in common is just that - Israel. \n\nEdit - ok that must be it. The foreign tax. 25% tax on your dividends explains, to me at least, why there would be an offset in valuations compared with american or other markets. ",

There are tons of companies in significantly better geopolitical environments than Israel, and the long term affects of this war on the economy(Israel is spending a massive amount on the war, and financing it at high interest rates) could be catastrophic. If you're looking for countries with value, look for countries not actively at war. It seems like China is doing a lot to re-attract foreign capital, and it's unlikely that the country invades Taiwan any time soon. European markets are also pretty flat right now.

Add on the current conflict and split opinions the impact of GLP-1s on their business, they may struggle for some time.\n\nRegarding interest rates, their products are largely financed when purchased. The selling price in the US is about 2-2.5x that OUS. Payback periods are quick based on an ASP of $130k but high rates are still deterring purchases. Lenders have also been slower in lending. INMDs clientele are also not wealthy. Average income of $60k. They are sensitive to higher interest rates.\n\nGeopolitical risk will be there for some time but the US being right off the coast should keep things from getting out of control. All 3 of INMDs primary manufacturers (outsourced) are in Israel. They have a buffer from the borders but Israel is so small that it may not matter much if things do escalate. GLP-1s in my view are not an issue. Overall, it should boost demand.\n\nLaser-based products have an installed base of 40-50k in the US. IMND was at around 7.5k at the end of 2022. INMDs products do the same things as lasers (for what they market them for), but better. They are finding new indications (ENT, Ophthalmology, Women's and Men's health) to increase their TAM and have a pile of cash they will have to do something with. All of this with strong IP protection through this decade and likely into the 2030s. Long-term, I think they recover just fine. Short-term may be ugly though.",

The Quartr app is a great tool for this.\n\nEDIT: I see you invested in some of these companies because they pay a dividend. Might be worth reading up on the considerations. See [this article](https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-stock-dividend) on how it is not free money, and [this one](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082015/3-biggest-misconceptions-dividend-stocks.asp) on misconceptions.",

If that doesn't appeal to you, just go with something straightforward like VTI or VOO. Try to keep individual stock picking to no more than 5% of your total investments.\n\nAs a beginner, it's easy to make expensive mistakes and challenging to consistently outperform the market over the long term. Don't take my word for it; there's strong evidence showing that simply holding onto market indices beats 80-95% of managed mutual funds over a decade, and the results are even more pronounced over longer periods.\n\nAt this stage, you likely don't have the expertise needed to effectively manage the risks associated with picking stocks. It's better to grow your wealth passively and maybe experiment with a small portion of your portfolio to get a feel for the market. This way, you minimize potential losses, which saves more of your capital for investing once you've mastered the basics and developed a solid strategy.\n\nPicking individual stocks is tough. It involves a deep dive into financial reports, understanding business models, analyzing fundamentals, forecasting growth, and estimating the true value of a company. This process requires a lot of reading, a solid grasp of financial principles, disciplined effort, and considerable time. Plus, it comes with increased risks like overconcentration in certain stocks or sectors and other market-related vulnerabilities.",

PYPL etc..\n\nHowever they\u2019re an up and coming growth stock which I believe is undervalued based out of Calgary, AB. \n\nThey currently have a market cap of 312M, trading at 4.30/share.\n\nThey\u2019re expected to continue to grow at >30% CAGR for the next few years. - TD Cowen Analyst\n\nThey sold their first company (BW Technologies) to HoneyWell in 2006.\n\nThey got back to work in the Gas Detection Industry and have now developed a product that far exceeds all their peers. They\u2019ve started gaining name recognition AND with new caveat to the business\u2026 They now offer SaaS paired with their hardware. This is creating extremely sticky returning sales with 120% Net Retention as clients love the services being offered.\n\nThey have solid financials, great growth and a great product.\n\nInsider Ownership is sitting around 30%, Institutional ownership is also high.\n\nI do own shares, however am looking to hear what you guys think.\n\nWith interest rates expected to decline over the next few years and my expectations that money will rotate into growth, I see a great opportunity for this company to thrive and potentially be acquired for a good premium.\n\nCheers!",
